# LLMs.txt Plugin for Pomerium Documentation

This Docusaurus plugin automatically generates an `llms.txt` file during the build process, making the documentation easily discoverable and consumable by Large Language Models (LLMs).

## How it works

The plugin:

1. **Runs during build**: Executes in the `postBuild` lifecycle hook
2. **Analyzes routes**: Examines all documentation routes generated by Docusaurus
3. **Categorizes content**: Groups pages by documentation section (Getting Started, Deployment, etc.)
4. **Generates structure**: Creates a well-organized markdown file with links and descriptions
5. **Outputs file**: Writes `llms.txt` to the build output directory

## Features

- **Automatic categorization**: Routes are automatically grouped based on URL structure
- **Smart sorting**: Important pages (like quickstart) are prioritized within categories
- **Metadata extraction**: Uses page titles and descriptions from frontmatter
- **Build integration**: Runs as part of the normal Docusaurus build process
- **Error handling**: Provides clear feedback if generation fails

## Generated Structure

The generated `llms.txt` file includes:

- **Header**: Site description and purpose
- **Categorized sections**:
  - Getting Started
  - Core Concepts
  - Deployment
  - Configuration and Reference
  - Advanced Capabilities
  - Integrations and Guides
  - API and Internals
  - Examples
  - Training
- **Footer**: Usage permissions statement

## Usage

The plugin is automatically activated during `docusaurus build`. The generated `llms.txt` file will be available at the root of the built site (e.g., `https://www.pomerium.com/llms.txt`).

## Configuration

The plugin currently requires no configuration options, but could be extended to support:

- Custom categorization rules
- Include/exclude patterns
- Custom descriptions
- Additional metadata extraction

## Example Output

```markdown
# Pomerium Documentation

This file contains information about Pomerium's public documentation...

## Getting Started

- [Quick Start](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/get-started/quickstart): Get up and running with Pomerium in minutes
- [Fundamentals](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/get-started/fundamentals): Core concepts and architecture overview

## Core Concepts

- [Authentication](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/capabilities/authentication): How Pomerium verifies user identity
- [Authorization](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/capabilities/authorization): How Pomerium controls access to resources ...
```

This approach ensures the `llms.txt` file stays automatically synchronized with the actual documentation structure and content.
