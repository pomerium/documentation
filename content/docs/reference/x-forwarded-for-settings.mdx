# X-Forwarded-For Settings

The `X-Forwarded-For` (XFF) HTTP header lists the IP addresses a request has passed through on its way from the end user (client) to a backend service.

(This is most relevant for deployments where there is another L7 proxy or load balancer in front of Pomerium, or in between Pomerium and upstream services.)

The following settings affect the way Pomerium sets or consumes the XFF header.

## Skip XFF Append

By default, when Pomerium receives a request, it appends the IP address of the direct downstream client to the XFF header before proxying the request to the upstream service.

However, if you set the **Skip XFF Append** (`skip_xff_append`) option to `true`, Pomerium will not modify an incoming XFF header. Instead, Pomerium will pass this incoming header to the upstream service unchanged.

### How to configure

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Core" label="Core">

| **Config file keys** | **Environment variables** | **Type**  | **Default** |
| :------------------- | :------------------------ | :-------- | :---------- |
| `skip_xff_append`    | `SKIP_XFF_APPEND`         | `boolean` | `false`     |

### Examples

```yaml
skip_xff_append: true
```

```bash
SKIP_XFF_APPEND=true
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Enterprise" label="Enterprise">

Configure **X-Forward-For HTTP Header** with the toggle button in the Console. The button has three states:

- **Unset** ("-") uses the value in your configuration file
- **Checkmark** sets `skip_xff_append` to `true`
- **Empty** sets `skip_xff_append` to `false`

### Skip XFF Append examples

Assume you have a load balancer in front of Pomerium, and it connects to Pomerium from IP address `10.1.2.3`. Say that the load balancer is configured to populate the `X-Forwarded-For` header, so that if a client connects to the load balancer from IP address `192.0.5.1`, then the load balancer will set `X-Forwarded-For: 192.0.5.1` on the request to Pomerium.

With `skip_xff_append` set to `false` (the default behavior), Pomerium will then append the IP address of the load balancer on the request made to the upstream service:

```plain title="Request Details"
X-Forwarded-For: 192.0.5.1,10.1.2.3
```

With `skip_xff_append` set to `true`, Pomerium will not append the IP address of the load balancer on the request made to the upstream service:

```plain title="Request Details"
X-Forwarded-For: 192.0.5.1
```

## XFF Number of Trusted Hops

The **XFF Number of Trusted Hops** (`xff_num_trusted_hops`) setting instructs Pomerium whether to trust an incoming request's XFF header.

When unset or set to `0`, Pomerium will not trust the incoming XFF header. Pomerium will consider the client IP address to be the IP address of the direct downstream client.

This affects the client IP address logged in the access logs (if configured; see [Access log fields](/docs/reference/access-log-fields#access-log-fields-and-defaults)). The client IP address is also sent to the upstream service in the [`x-envoy-external-address` header](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_conn_man/headers#x-envoy-external-address).

:::info X-Forwarded-Proto header

This setting also affects whether Pomerium trusts the [`X-Forwarded-Proto` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Proto). This header indicates the originating protocol (either HTTP or HTTPS) of the downstream client request. Pomerium will only trust the downstream `X-Forwarded-Proto` header if you set `xff_num_trusted_hops` to a _non-zero_ value.

When set to `0`, Pomerium will set the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header to either `http` or `https` depending on whether the downstream connection is secured over TLS.

### XFF Number of Trusted Hops examples

As in the previous example, assume you have a load balancer in front of Pomerium, which connects to Pomerium from IP address `10.1.2.3`, and is configured to populate the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

With `xff_num_trusted_hops` set to `0`, Pomerium's access log will show the load balancer IP address (`10.1.2.3`) as the client IP address for all incoming requests.

```yaml {title="config.yaml"}
xff_num_trusted_hops: 0
access_log_fields: [forwarded-for, ip, method, path]
```

Example access log entry:

```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "service": "envoy",
  "forwarded-for": "192.0.5.1,10.1.2.3",
  "ip": "10.1.2.3",
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/",
  "time": "2024-07-08T16:42:48-07:00",
  "message": "http-request"
}
```

With the `xff_num_trusted_hops` option set to `1`, Pomerium will trust the client IP address populated by the load balancer:

```yaml {title="config.yaml"}
xff_num_trusted_hops: 1
access_log_fields: [forwarded-for, ip, method, path]
```

Example access log entry:

```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "service": "envoy",
  "forwarded-for": "192.0.5.1,10.1.2.3",
  // highlight-next-line
  "ip": "192.0.5.1",
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/",
  "time": "2024-07-08T16:42:48-07:00",
  "message": "http-request"
}
```
