## Envoy Proxy Metrics

As of `v0.9`, Pomerium uses [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) for the data plane. As such, proxy related metrics are sourced from Envoy, and use Envoy's internal [stats data model](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/operations/stats_overview). Please see Envoy's documentation for information about specific metrics.

All metrics coming from Envoy will be labeled with `service="pomerium"` or `service="pomerium-proxy"`, depending if you're running all-in-one or distributed service mode and have `pomerium` prefix added to the standard envoy metric name.

See [Configuration & Settings](/docs/internals/configuration#all-in-one-vs-split-service-mode) for more information configuration environments.
