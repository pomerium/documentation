# Authenticate Service URL

- Environmental Variable: `AUTHENTICATE_SERVICE_URL`
- Config File Key: `authenticate_service_url`
- Kubernetes: [`authenticate.url`](/docs/deploying/k8s/reference#authenticate)
- Type: `URL`
- Required
- Example: `https://authenticate.corp.example.com`

Authenticate Service URL is the externally accessible URL for the authenticate service. In split service mode, this key is required by all services other than Databroker.

:::tip **Note:**

Pomerium uses the [**Hosted Authenticate Service**](/docs/capabilities/hosted-authenticate-service) by default.

If you want to run Pomerium with a self-hosted authenticate service, you must include an [**identity provider**](/docs/identity-providers) and **authenticate service URL** in your configuration.

See [**Self-Hosted Authenticate Service**](/docs/capabilities/self-hosted-authenticate-service) for more information.
