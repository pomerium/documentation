Path to file containing a secret used to encrypt and sign session cookies. You can generate a random key with `head -c32 /dev/urandom | base64`.

This is useful when deploying in environments that provide secret management like [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/). For example:

```yaml
cookie_secret_file: '/run/secrets/POMERIUM_COOKIE_SECRET'
```
