The `policy` block inside a `route` definition defines the authorization policy applied to a route. Policies are defined using Pomerium Policy Language (**PPL**), a yaml-based markup designed to be easier to read and implement compared to current alternatives.

See [Pomerium Policy Language](/docs/capabilities/ppl) for a full explanation of how to write policies in PPL.
