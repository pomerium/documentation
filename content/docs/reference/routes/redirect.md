- `path_redirect` (string): the incoming path portion of the URL will be swapped with the given value.
- `prefix_rewrite` (string): the incoming matched prefix will be swapped with the given value.
- `response_code` (integer): the response code to use for the redirect. Defaults to 301.
- `strip_query` (boolean): indicates that during redirection, the query portion of the URL will be removed. Defaults to false.

Either `redirect` or `to` must be set.
