# From

## Summary

**From** is the externally accessible URL for the proxied request.

Specifying `tcp+https` for the scheme enables [TCP proxying](/docs/capabilities/tcp/) support for the route. You may map more than one port through the same hostname by specifying a different `:port` in the URL.

## How to configure

The `URL` must contain a **scheme** and **hostname** and cannot contain a path.

:::note

Only secure schemes (`https` and `tcp+https`) are supported.

| `from`                    | `URL`    | `https`, `tcp+https` | **required** |

### Examples

```yaml
routes:
  - from: https://verify.corp.example.com
  - to: https://example.com
```

```yaml
# TCP
routes:
  - from: tcp+https://ssh.corp.example.com:22
  - to: tcp://example.com:22
```

## Wildcard From Routes

:::caution

Kubernetes: Wildcard From Routes in Kubernetes are unofficially supported because Pomerium's implementation behaves differently than what Kubernetes defines in their documentation. See [Wildcard Hostnames](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#hostname-wildcards) for more information.

:::

**Wildcard From Routes** supports the use of a wildcard asterisk (`*`) placed anywhere within the domain name portion of a `from` URL.

Defining a `from` route with `*` will point any matching routes to the defined [To route](/docs/reference/routes/to). This eliminates the need to define multiple near-identical routes in your configuration. ([Autocert](/docs/reference/autocert) will be disabled for hosts that use Wildcard From Routes.)

For example:

```yaml
# Before:
routes:
  - from: https://a.example.com
    to: https://example.com
  - from: https://b.example.com
    to: https://example.com
  - from: https://c.example.com
    to: https://example.com
  - from: https://d.example.com
    to: https://example.com
  - from: https://e.example.com
    to: https://example.com

# After
routes:
  - from: https://*.example.com
    to: https://example.com

# Or

routes:
  - from: tcp+https://*.example.com:22
    to: tcp://example.com:22
```

:::tip **Note**

Wildcard From Routes (`*`) may take precedence over non-wildcard routes regardless of their ordering, and more specific wildcard routes will take precedence over less specific wildcard routes.

In the example below, **Route C** will take priority over routes **A** or **B**:

```yaml
# Route A
https://*.localhost.pomerium.io

# Route B
https://a*.localhost.pomerium.io

# Route C
https://a*a.localhost.pomerium.io
```
