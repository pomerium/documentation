# From

## Summary

**From** is the externally accessible URL for the proxied request.

Specifying `tcp+https` for the scheme enables [TCP proxying](/docs/capabilities/tcp/) support for the route. You may map more than one port through the same hostname by specifying a different `:port` in the URL.

## How to configure

The `URL` must contain a **scheme** and **hostname** and cannot contain a path.

:::note

Only secure schemes (`https` and `tcp+https`) are supported.

### Examples

```yaml
routes:
  - from: https://verify.corp.example.com
  - to: https://example.com
```

```yaml
# TCP
routes:
  - from: tcp+https://ssh.corp.example.com:22
  - to: tcp://example.com:22
```

## Wildcard From Routes

:::caution

Kubernetes: Wildcard From Routes in Kubernetes are unofficially supported because Pomerium's implementation behaves differently than what Kubernetes defines in their documentation. See [Wildcard Hostnames](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#hostname-wildcards) for more information.

:::

**Wildcard From Routes** supports the use of a wildcard asterisk (`*`) placed anywhere within the domain name portion of a `from` URL.

Defining a `from` route with `*` will point any matching routes to the defined [To route](/docs/reference/routes/to). This eliminates the need to define multiple near-identical routes in your configuration. ([Autocert](/docs/reference/autocert) will be disabled for hosts that use Wildcard From Routes.)

For example:

```yaml
# Before:
routes:
  - from: https://a.example.com
    to: https://example.com
  - from: https://b.example.com
    to: https://example.com
  - from: https://c.example.com
    to: https://example.com
  - from: https://d.example.com
    to: https://example.com
  - from: https://e.example.com
    to: https://example.com

# After
routes:
  - from: https://*.example.com
    to: https://example.com

# Or

routes:
  - from: tcp+https://*.example.com:22
    to: tcp://example.com:22
```

### Wildcard processing behavior

Pomerium processes routes in the order they are defined in the configuration file. However, routes which **don't** contain wildcards (`*`) may take precedence over routes which **do** contain wildcards.

For example, given the routes below, if you send a request to `foo.example.com`, Pomerium would redirect the request to `1.example.com`.

If you send a request to `bar.example.com` (a non-wildcard route), Pomerium would redirect the request to `2.example.com`.

```yaml
routes:
  - from: https://*.example.com
    to: http://1.example.com
  - from: https://bar.example.com
    to: http://2.example.com
```
