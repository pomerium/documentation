# From

## Summary

The **From** URL is the externally accessible URL for a proxied HTTP request.

Specifying `tcp+https` for the scheme enables [TCP proxying](/docs/capabilities/tcp/) support for the route. You may map more than one port through the same hostname by specifying a different `:port` in the URL.

## How to configure

The From URL must contain a **scheme** and **hostname**. It can't contain a path. When defining a From URL, you must use `https` or `tcp+https`. Pomerium only supports secure schemes.

### Port matching behavior

In v0.26, we've updated the route matching behavior. If you do not specify a port number in a route's From URL, the route will match incoming requests with any port number (or no port number). If you do specify a port number, that route will match only requests containing that specific port number.

With a From URL like the one below:

```yaml
from: https://www.example.com
```

Pomerium will match incoming requests on any port:

```yaml
https://www.example.com

https://www.example.com:443

https://www.example.com:8443

https://www.example.com:3000
```

If you specify the port in the From URL, Pomerium will only match incoming requests that specify this port:

```yaml
from: https://www.example.com:8443
```

:::tip

You can disable this behavior with the [**Match Any Incoming Port**](/docs/reference/runtime-flags) runtime flag.

## Wildcard From Routes

:::caution

Kubernetes: Wildcard From Routes in Kubernetes are unofficially supported because Pomerium's implementation behaves differently than what Kubernetes defines in their documentation. See [Wildcard Hostnames](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#hostname-wildcards) for more information.

:::

**Wildcard From Routes** supports the use of a wildcard asterisk (`*`) placed anywhere within the domain name portion of a `from` URL.

Defining a `from` route with `*` will point any matching routes to the defined [To route](/docs/reference/routes/to). This eliminates the need to define multiple near-identical routes in your configuration. ([Autocert](/docs/reference/autocert) will be disabled for hosts that use Wildcard From Routes.)

For example:

```yaml
# Before:
routes:
  - from: https://a.example.com
    to: https://example.com
  - from: https://b.example.com
    to: https://example.com
  - from: https://c.example.com
    to: https://example.com
  - from: https://d.example.com
    to: https://example.com
  - from: https://e.example.com
    to: https://example.com

# After
routes:
  - from: https://*.example.com
    to: https://example.com

# Or

routes:
  - from: tcp+https://*.example.com:22
    to: tcp://example.com:22
```

### Wildcard processing behavior

Pomerium processes routes in the order they are defined in the configuration file. However, routes which **don't** contain wildcards (`*`) may take precedence over routes which **do** contain wildcards.

For example, given the routes below, if you send a request to `foo.example.com`, Pomerium would redirect the request to `1.example.com`.

If you send a request to `bar.example.com` (a non-wildcard route), Pomerium would redirect the request to `2.example.com`.

```yaml
routes:
  - from: https://*.example.com
    to: http://1.example.com
  - from: https://bar.example.com
    to: http://2.example.com
```
