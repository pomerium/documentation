Path to a file containing a [Signing Key](./signing-key), the private key used to sign a user's attestation JWT which can be consumed by upstream applications to pass along identifying user information like username, id, and groups.

See [Signing Key](./signing-key) for more information.

This is useful when deploying in environments that provide secret management like [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/). For example:

```yaml
signing_key_file: '/run/secrets/POMERIUM_SIGNING_KEY'
```
