# Allowed IdP Claims

- `yaml`/`json` setting: `allowed_idp_claims`
- Type: map of `strings` lists
- Required

Allowed IdP Claims is a collection of whitelisted claim key-value pairs to authorize for a given route.

This is useful if your identity provider has extra information about a user that is not in the directory. It can also be useful if you wish to use groups with the generic OIDC provider.

Example:

```yaml
- from: http://from.example.com
  to: http://to.example.com
  allowed_idp_claims:
    family_name:
      - Doe
      - Smith
```

This policy would match users with the `family_name` claim containing `Smith` or `Doe`.

Claims are represented as a map of strings to a list of values:

```json
{
  "family_name": ["Doe"],
  "given_name": ["John"]
}
```

- Nested maps are flattened: `{ "a": { "b": ["c"] } }` becomes `{ "a.b": ["c"] }`
- Values are always a list: `{ "a": "b" }` becomes `{ "a": ["b"] }`
