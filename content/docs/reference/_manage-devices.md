From this page, administrators can manage new and existing device enrollments.

Device enrollment let's you create [policies](/docs/capabilities/ppl#device-matcher) that use [device identity](/docs/concepts/device-identity).

- Users can [self-enroll](/docs/integrations/device-context/device-identit) devices, which must then be approved in the **Devices List** for policies requiring approved devices.
- Administrators can use the **New Enrollment** button to create a link for the user to enroll a device as pre-approved. See our [Pre-Approved Device Enrollment](/docs/guides/admin-enroll-device) guide for more information.
