Turning on autocert allows Pomerium to automatically retrieve, manage, and renew public facing TLS certificates from [Let's Encrypt][letsencrypt] which includes managed routes and the authenticate service.  [Autocert Directory](/docs/reference/autocert/autocert-directory) must be used with Autocert must have a place to persist, and share certificate data between services. Note that autocert also provides [OCSP stapling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling).

This setting can be useful in situations where you may not have Pomerium behind a TLS terminating ingress or proxy that is already handling your public certificates on your behalf.
