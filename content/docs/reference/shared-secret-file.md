Shared Secret File is the location of a file containing the base64 encoded 256-bit key used to mutually authenticate requests between services. It's critical that secret keys are random, and stored safely. Use a key management system or `/dev/urandom` to generate a key. For example:

```sh
head -c32 /dev/urandom | base64
```

`shared_secret_file` points to a file containing the secret. This is useful when deploying in environments that provide secret management like [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/). For example:

```yaml
shared_secret_file: '/run/secrets/POMERIUM_SHARED_SECRET'
```

:::tip

If you adjust your shared secret and/or how it's accessed by Pomerium, you may create a [secret mismatch](/docs/internals/troubleshooting#redis-secret-mismatch).
