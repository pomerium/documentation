- Type: [Go Duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration.String) `string`
- Example: `TIMEOUT_READ=30s`
- Defaults: `TIMEOUT_READ=30s` `TIMEOUT_WRITE=0` `TIMEOUT_IDLE=5m`

Timeouts set the global server timeouts. Timeouts can also be set for individual [routes](/docs/reference/routes).

- `idle_timeout`: The idle timeout is the time at which a downstream or upstream connection will be terminated if there are no active streams.
- `write_timeout`: The max stream duration is the maximum time that a streamâ€™s lifetime will span. An HTTP request/response exchange fully consumes a single stream. Therefore, this value must be greater than read_timeout as it covers both request and response time.
- `read_timeout`: The amount of time for the entire request stream to be received from the client.
