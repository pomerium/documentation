## Service Accounts

Service accounts offer a protected and standardized method of authenticating machine-to-machine communication between services protected by Pomerium.

:::tip

Before you begin, confirm you are in the correct Namespace. A service account can only be used in the Namespace it was created in, including its children Namespaces.

:::

1. From the main menu, select **Service Accounts** under **CONFIGURE**. Click the **+ ADD SERVICE ACCOUNT** button:

1. Service accounts can be unique and exist only for Pomerium, or impersonate directory users from your IdP.

   Give the user a unique ID, or select an existing user to impersonate. Consider referencing the Namespace you're creating it under, for easier reference later. Optionally set an expiration date:

   The user ID set here corresponds to the `User` criteria when editing a policy.

1. After you click **Submit**, the modal presents the JSON web token (**JWT**) for the service account. Temporarily save it somewhere secure, as you will not be able to view it again:

   This JWT must be added to your application configuration to enable direct communication.

1. Edit or create policies to give the service account access to the internal service:
