# Tunneled Git Connections

When hosting a self-hosted Git server like [GitLab](/docs/guides/gitlab) behind Pomerium, you can protect desktop client access to the source code with the same identity-aware access as the web interface using an encrypted TCP tunnel.

:::note Long-lived connections behavior

:::tip
This example assumes you've already [created a TCP route](/docs/capabilities/tcp#configure-routes) for this service.

 ## Basic Connection

 1. Create a TCP tunnel, using either [`pomerium-cli`](/docs/deploy/clients/pomerium-cli) or the Pomerium Desktop client. These examples use Git connections over SSH:

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="pomerium-cli" label="pomerium-cli">

    ```bash
    pomerium-cli tcp git.corp.example.com:22 --listen :2202
    ```

    :::tip --listen
    The `--listen` flag is optional. It lets you define what port the tunnel listens on locally. If not specified, the client will choose a random available port.
    :::

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Pomerium Desktop" label="Pomerium Desktop">

    ![An example connection to a Git service from Pomerium Desktop](img/desktop/example-git-connection.png)

    :::tip Local Address
    The **Local Address** field is optional. Using it defines what port the tunnel listens on locally. If not specified, Pomerium Desktop will choose a random available port.
    :::

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

1. Clone the repository using the tunneled connection as a remote:

    ```bash
    git clone ssh://git@127.0.0.1:2202/username/project-name
    ```

Now when you first initiate a `pull`, `push`, or `fetch` command your web browser will open to authenticate and authorize the connection.

## Always Tunnel through Pomerium

Because Git uses the SSH protocol, we can define a `Host` block in our local SSH configuration file to initiate the tunneled connection whenever it's needed.

1. Open your local SSH configuration file at `~/.ssh/config` and add a new Hosts `block`:

    ```bash
    Host git-tunnel
      HostName git.corp.example.com
      User git
      ProxyCommand pomerium-cli tcp --listen - %h:%p
    ```

1. For each repository, clone using this host:

    ```bash
    git clone git@git-tunnel:userName/projectName
    ```

:::tip
If you've already defined an SSH configuration for all domains managed by Pomerium as described in our [SSH Example](/docs/capabilities/tcp/examples/ssh#always-tunnel-through-pomerium), you can skip the first step above and define your new remote with the Git server's domain name.
