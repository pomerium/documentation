# Pomerium Desktop and CLI Clients

This document describes how to use Pomerium's Desktop and CLI clients to connect to TCP routes in Pomerium.

:::info What's a TCP route?

A TCP route is for use with upstream services that don't speak HTTP â€” for example SSH, Redis, or MySQL. With a TCP route, the entire connection is proxied to the upstream service, rather than each individual request separately.

In Pomerium, TCP routes are denoted with a `tcp+` prefix in the route's **From** URL.

:::

## Create a TCP route

1. Specify this new Route as a TCP Route by prefixing `tcp+` in the **From** field, along with a port number
1. Set the **To** field using `tcp://` as the scheme, along with the address and port that the upstream service is listening on

The example below demonstrates a route to an SSH service on the host running Pomerium:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="pomerium-enterprise" label="Pomerium Enterprise">

![Example TCP route for SSH](./img/tcp-ssh-route.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pomerium-core" label="Pomerium Core">

```yaml
- from: tcp+https://ssh.localhost.pomerium.io:22
  to: tcp://127.0.0.1:22
  policy:
    - allow:
        or:
          - email:
              is: user@companydomain.com
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip

The port number in the route **From** URL is not used in the initial connection to Pomerium itself. This connection will still use port 443, unless you use a bastion host (see [**Advanced configuration**](#advanced-configuration) below).

Rather, the port defined in **From** is part of the mapping to the individual route. In this way, you can create multiple routes that share a DNS entry, differentiated by the port to determine which route they use.

For example, suppose we have a server called `augur` running behind Pomerium that has a MySQL server and also listens for SSH connections. We can create routes for `tcp+https://augur.example.com:22` and `tcp+https://augur.example.com:3306`.

## Access TCP routes with a client

You can connect to this route with either the Pomerium CLI or Pomerium Desktop client.

### Desktop client steps

If you haven't, install [Pomerium Desktop](/docs/deploy/clients/pomerium-desktop).

Then, add a connection by filling in the fields defined below:

- **Name**: A local name for the route
- **Destination**: Matches the [From](/docs/reference/routes/from) value of the route, without the protocol. Always include the port specified in the route, and do not include the `https://` protocol.
- **Local Address**: The local address and port number from which to access the service locally. If left blank, the client will choose a random port to listen to on the loopback address.
- **Tags**: Customizable tags to sort and organize TCP routes

#### Advanced Settings

- **Pomerium URL**: The Pomerium Proxy service address. This is required if the **Destination URL** can't be resolved from DNS or a local `hosts` entry, or if the Proxy service uses a non-standard port.
- **Disable TLS Verification**: Allows untrusted certificates from the Pomerium gateway
- **Client Certificates**: For routes that enforce [mTLS](/docs/concepts/mutual-auth), you can **set a client certificate manually** or automatically [**search the OS certificate store**](/docs/capabilities/tcp#client-certificates) for a trusted certificate (note: macOS and Windows only).

### Pomerium CLI steps

If you haven't, install [Pomerium CLI](/docs/deploy/clients/pomerium-cli).

Then, connect to a TCP route:

1. Invoke `pomerium-cli` with the `tcp` option, and provide the route to your service (as defined in [`from`](/docs/reference/routes/from) in your Route specification).

   ```shell-session
   $ pomerium-cli tcp ssh.localhost.pomerium.io:22
   2023/10/02 11:29:22 listening on 127.0.0.1:53656
   ```

   You can optionally supply an address and/or port to the `listen` flag:

   ```shell-session
   $ pomerium-cli tcp ssh.localhost.pomerium.io:22 --listen :2222
   2023/10/02 11:30:03 listening on [::]:2222
   ```

1. Connect to your service using the local address and port specified in the output of `pomerium-cli`:

   ```bash
   ssh 127.0.0.1 -p 2222
   ```

1. When the connection starts, the CLI will open your browser and direct you to your Identity Provider to authenticate your session. Once authenticated, the connection will continue and you can close the browser window.

1. In this example, since we are using SSH we can consolidate the TCP and SSH connections into a single command:

   ```bash
   ssh -o ProxyCommand='pomerium-cli tcp --listen - %h:%p' ssh.localhost.pomerium.io
   ```

- [**Securing TCP-based Services**](/docs/guides/securing-tcp)

:::

## Advanced configuration

If Pomerium is listening on a port other than `443` (set with the [`address` key](/docs/reference/address)), the full TCP URL can be specified with a bastion host:

```bash
pomerium-cli tcp tcp+https://ssh.localhost:pomerium.io:8443/ssh.localhost.pomerium.io:2222 --listen :2222
```
