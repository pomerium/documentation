## Overview

JWTs provide a secure and efficient means to authenticate and authorize users before they can access upstream services behind Pomerium. When configured for JWT authentication, Pomerium sends its own JWT to the upstream service. By verifying the Pomerium JWT, the upstream service can:

- Confirm that the Pomerium Proxy service handled the client request before forwarding it.
- Make application-level authorization decisions based on the user's associated identity information.

## Why JWT authentication?

### Identity verification

JWT authentication through Pomerium enables an upstream service to verify a user's identity based on claims contained in the JWT. Pomerium signs and issues a new JWT based on the ID token received from the service's configured identity provider.

### Request verification

Pomerium places the newly minted JWT in a [JWT assertion header](#jwt-assertion-header). The upstream service should only accept the incoming request if it satisfies all [JWT validation](#jwt-validation) conditions.

By validating the JWT, the upstream service can assert that:

- The request originated from Pomerium.
- The user was authenticated.
- The request was authorized in accordance with the route's authorization policy.

:::note

The Pomerium JWT does not contain any path information for an upstream service. If you've configured multiple routes with different paths for the same upstream service (such as an `/admin` route that grants access to a limited set of users), the application can't determine which Pomerium route the JWT corresponds to.

:::

### Single Sign-on (SSO)

You can configure upstream services to accept JWTs sent by Pomerium to achieve an SSO authentication flow. This capability is completely free and relatively easy to configure depending on the upstream service and your [identity provider](/docs/identity-providers).

:::info Implement SSO with Pomerium

See our [**Grafana**](/docs/guides/grafana) guide for a real-world example of how configuring both Pomerium and and an upstream service can provide easy SSO access for your end users.

### Identity provider authentication

Pomerium requires users to authenticate against an OIDC-compliant identity provider before authorizing or denying a request to an upstream service.

After successful authentication, Pomerium mints a new [**Pomerium JWT**](#pomerium-jwt) based on the **ID token** generated by the identity provider. (This is Pomerium's default behavior, even if you haven't configured Pomerium to support JWT authentication.)

### JWT assertion header

Pomerium signs the Pomerium JWT with a [signing key](/docs/reference/signing-key), and places it into a special HTTP header called the JWT assertion header. Pomerium includes the JWT assertion header in every request it forwards to the upstream service (if the [pass identity headers](/docs/reference/routes/pass-identity-headers-per-route) setting is enabled).

:::info JWT assertion header field

Pomerium passes the JWT in the `X-Pomerium-Jwt-Assertion` HTTP header, and encodes it according to [RFC7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519).

:::

### JWT validation

The upstream service receives the `X-Pomerium-Jwt-Assertion-Header` with the encrypted JWT. To validate a JWT, the service should check the following items:

- [JWT signature](#jwt-signature)
- [Audience (`aud`) and issuer (`iss`) claims](#aud-and-iss-claims)
- [JWT timestamps](#jwt-timestamps)

#### JWT signature

The upstream service should validate that the JWT was signed by the issuing authority.

Pomerium issues and signs the new JWT with a private signing key. To validate the signature, the upstream service must fetch the corresponding public key from Pomerium's [JSON web key set](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517#section-5) (JWKS) endpoint.

To configure your service to fetch the public key:

1. Get the hostname from the JWT's `iss` claim
1. Append the `/.well-known/pomerium/jwks.json` path to the hostname
1. Prepend the `https://` scheme to the URL
1. Set the `Accept: application/json` header in the request

For example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Hosted Authenticate" value="hosted-authenticate">

```bash
curl https://service.corp.example.com/.well-known/pomerium/jwks.json \
-H 'Accept: application/json'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Self-hosted Authenticate" value="self-hosted-authenticate">

```bash
curl https://<AUTHENTICATE-SERVICE-URL>/.well-known/pomerium/jwks.json \
-H 'Accept: application/json'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The returned JWK key set contains the public keys Pomerium uses. Use the `kid` claim from the Pomerium JWT to find the correct key in the returned key set.

```json title="JWKS response"
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "use": "sig",
      "kty": "EC",
      // highlight-start
      "kid": "ccc5bc9d835ff3c8f7075ed4a7510159cf440fd7bf7b517b5caeb1fa419ee6a1",
      // highlight-end
      "crv": "P-256",
      "alg": "ES256",
      "x": "QCN7adG2AmIK3UdHJvVJkldsUc6XeBRz83Z4rXX8Va4",
      "y": "PI95b-ary66nrvA55TpaiWADq8b3O1CYIbvjqIHpXCY"
    }
  ]
}
```

If the JWT signature can't be validated, the JWT is invalid and can't be trusted.

#### Aud and iss claims

The upstream service should verify that the `aud` and `iss` claims match the domain used to serve your application.

The `aud` claim identifies the recipient the JWT is intended for. In the context of a service behind Pomerium, the `aud` claim should always be set as the upstream service's domain name.

Since v0.22, Pomerium sets the `iss` claim also to the domain of the target upstream service. (In previous versions, this was instead set to the [authenticate service](/docs/reference/service-urls#authenticate-service-url) domain.)

If the domain provided in the `aud` and `iss` claims doesn't match the upstream service's domain name, the JWT is invalid and can't be trusted.

```json title="Valid aud and iss claims"
{
  "aud": "verify.pomerium.app",
  "iss": "verify.pomerium.app"
}
```

#### JWT timestamps

The upstream service should verify that the Pomerium JWT has not expired.

The `iat` claim informs you at what time the JWT was issued. The `exp` claim specifies the expiration time on or after which the JWT must be considered invalid. By default, Pomerium sets the `exp` claim to expire 5 minutes after the time it was issued.

By comparing the current time with the timestamps in the `exp` and `iat` claims, you can verify if the JWT has expired or not. We recommend allowing up to a 1-minute leeway when comparing the `exp` and `iat` timestamps to account for [clock skew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_skew) between Pomerium and the upstream service.

If the JWT has expired, it is invalid and can't be trusted.

:::tip JWT Verification with Pomerium SDKs

Pomerium's [**JWT Verification**](/docs/guides/verify-jwt) guide shows you how to use our custom JWT libraries to parse and validate the Pomerium JWT in an upstream service.

:::

After the upstream service validates the JWT, it can accept the request and trust other claims present in the JWT.

## The Pomerium JWT

Pomerium generates a new **Pomerium JWT** based on the claims data contained in the original ID token. In addition to including standard claims as defined in [RFC7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1), Pomerium also injects its own claims into the Pomerium JWT as well. (See [JWT claims data](#jwt-claims-data) below for more details.)

:::note

The original ID token sourced from an identity provider is never modified or leaked to end users or upstream services.

:::

### Pomerium JWT claims data

When Pomerium is configured for JWT authentication with the [pass identity headers](#jwt-settings) setting, the user's associated identity information will be included in the JWT assertion header in each upstream request. (The signed Pomerium JWT is also available at the special `/.pomerium/jwt` endpoint of any URL handled by Pomerium.)

The Pomerium JWT contains at least the following claims:

| JWT Claim | Description |
| :-: | --- |
| `jti` | A randomly generated UUID that represents the JWT ID. |
| `exp` | Expiration time in seconds since the UNIX epoch. Set to expire 5 minutes after `iat` time. |
| `iat` | Issued-at time in seconds since the UNIX epoch. |
| `aud` | The domain for the upstream application (for example, `httpbin.corp.example.com`). |
| `iss` | Same as the `aud` claim. |
| `sub` | The user's ID, as specified by the identity provider. |
| `email` | The user's email address. |
| `groups` | The user's group memberships (if supported for the identity provider). |
| `name` | The user's full name, as specified by the identity provider. |

### JWT Settings

Use these settings to configure Pomerium to forward the Pomerium JWT to upstream services:

- [Pass Identity Headers (global)](/docs/reference/pass-identity-headers)
- [Pass Identity Headers (per route)](/docs/reference/routes/pass-identity-headers-per-route)

If your identity provider provides other claims not included in the Pomerium JWT that you would like to pass to your application, you can use the [JWT Claims Headers](/docs/reference/jwt-claim-headers) option to include them in the JWT as well.
