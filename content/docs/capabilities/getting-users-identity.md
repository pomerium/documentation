## Overview

JWTs provide a secure and efficient means to authenticate and authorize users before they can access upstream services behind Pomerium. By default, Pomerium secures these connections over TLS, but you can also configure Pomerium to provide an additional layer of security with **JWT authentication** at the application level. This way, even if other security checks fail, the upstream service can grant or deny access based on the authenticity of the JWT.

## Why JWT authentication?

**Identity verification**

JWT authentication through Pomerium enables an upstream service to verify a user's identity based on claims contained in the JWT. Pomerium signs and issues a new JWT based on the ID token received from the service's configured identity provider, so the upstream service can verify that the claims were not modified in transit.

**Request verification**

Because Pomerium handles each request before forwarding it, the upstream service can verify that Pomerium processed and authorized the request according to the rules defined in the route's authorization policy.

:::note

If Pomerium is configured to forward JWTs, the upstream service behind Pomerium should only accept an incoming request if it can confirm that:

- The JWT is valid
- The user's identity is authenticated, and
- Pomerium processed the request

:::

**Single Sign-on (SSO)**

You can configure upstream services to accept JWTs sent by Pomerium to achieve an SSO authentication flow. This capability is completely free and relatively easy to configure depending on the upstream service and your [identity provider](/docs/identity-providers).

:::info Implement SSO with Pomerium

See our [**Grafana**](/docs/guides/grafana) guide for a real-world example of how configuring both Pomerium and and an upstream service can provide easy SSO access for your end users.

## JWT authentication flow

### Identity provider authentication

Pomerium requires users to authenticate against an OIDC-compliant identity provider before authorizing or denying a request to an upstream service.

After successful authentication, Pomerium mints a new [**Pomerium JWT**](#pomerium-jwt) based on the **ID token** generated by the identity provider. (This is Pomerium's default behavior, even if you haven't configured Pomerium to support JWT authentication.)

### Signed HTTP header

Pomerium signs the Pomerium JWT with a private [signing key](/docs/reference/signing-key) on behalf of the user, and places the JWT into a special HTTP header called the `X-Pomerium-Jwt-Assertion-Header`. This signed header is included in every request that Pomerium forwards to the upstream service.

### JWT validation

The upstream service receives the `X-Pomerium-Jwt-Assertion-Header` with the encrypted JWT. To validate a JWT, the service should check the following items:

- [JWT signature](#jwt-signature)
- [Audience (`aud`) and issuer (`iss`) claims](#aud-and-iss-claims)
- [JWT timestamps](#jwt-timestamps)

#### JWT signature

The upstream service should validate that the JWT was signed by the issuing authority.

Validating the JWT signature requires fetching the corresponding public key from the [**JSON web key set**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414#section-2) (JWKS) endpoint. The JWKS endpoint is reachable from any Pomerium-managed route domain at `/.well-known/pomerium/jwks.json`.

For example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Hosted Authenticate" value="hosted-authenticate">

:::note

When using the [hosted authenticate service](/docs/capabilities/hosted-authenticate-service), Pomerium uses the route domain as the [**Authenticate Service URL**](/docs/reference/authenticate-service-url).

:::

```bash
curl https://service.corp.example.com/.well-known/pomerium/jwks.json | jq
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Self-hosted Authenticate" value="self-hosted-authenticate">

```bash
curl https://<AUTHENTICATE-SERVICE-URL>/.well-known/pomerium/jwks.json | jq
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

A successful request returns a JSON object describing the signing key. The `kid` parameter contains the signing key ID, which is used to calculate the corresponding public key.

```json title="JWKS response"
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "use": "sig",
      "kty": "EC",
      // highlight-start
      "kid": "ccc5bc9d835ff3c8f7075ed4a7510159cf440fd7bf7b517b5caeb1fa419ee6a1",
      // highlight-end
      "crv": "P-256",
      "alg": "ES256",
      "x": "QCN7adG2AmIK3UdHJvVJkldsUc6XeBRz83Z4rXX8Va4",
      "y": "PI95b-ary66nrvA55TpaiWADq8b3O1CYIbvjqIHpXCY"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Aud and iss claims

The upstream service should verify that the `aud` and `iss` claims match the domain used to serve your application.

The `aud` claim identifies the recipient the JWT is intended for. In the context of a service behind Pomerium, the `aud` claim should always be set as the upstream service's domain name.

Pomerium sets the `iss` claim also to the domain of the target upstream service.

If the domain provided in the `aud` and `iss` claims doesn't match the upstream service's domain name, the JWT can't be validated or trusted.

#### JWT timestamps

The upstream service should verify that the Pomerium JWT has not expired.

The `iat` claim informs you at what time the JWT was issued. The `exp` claim specifies the expiration time on or after which the JWT must be considered invalid. By default, Pomerium sets the `exp` claim to expire 5 minutes after the time it was issued.

By comparing the current time with the timestamps in the `exp` and `iat` claims, you can verify if the JWT has expired or not. (We recommend allowing up to 1 minute leeway in this comparison, to account for clock skew between Pomerium and your application.)

If the JWT has expired, it is not longer valid and can't be trusted.

:::tip JWT Verification with Pomerium SDKs

Pomerium's [**JWT Verification**](/docs/guides/verify-jwt) guides provide custom libraries that enable upstream services to parse and validate the Pomerium JWT.

:::

After the upstream service validates the JWT, it can accept the JWT and the request.

## The Pomerium JWT

Pomerium generates a new **Pomerium JWT** based on the claims data contained in the original ID token. In addition to including standard claims as defined in [RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1), Pomerium also injects its own claims into the Pomeruim JWT as well. (See [JWT claims data](#jwt-claims-data) below for more details.)

:::note

The original ID token sourced from an identity provider is never modified or leaked to end users or upstream services.

:::

### Pomerium JWT claims data

When Pomerium is configured for JWT authentication, the user's associated identity information will be included in the signed `X-Pomerium-Jwt-Assertion` header in each upstream request. The signed Pomerium JWT is also available at the special `/.pomerium/jwt` endpoint of any URL handled by Pomerium.

The Pomerium JWT contains at least the following claims:

| claim | description |
| :-: | --- |
| `jti` | A randomly generated UUID that represents the JWT ID. |
| `exp` | Expiration time in seconds since the UNIX epoch. Set to expire 5 minutes after `iat` time. |
| `iat` | Issued-at time in seconds since the UNIX epoch. |
| `aud` | The domain for the upstream application (for example, `httpbin.corp.example.com`). |
| `iss` | Same as the `aud` claim. |
| `sub` | The user's ID, as specified by the identity provider. |
| `email` | The user's email address. |
| `groups` | The user's group memberships (if supported for the identity provider). |
| `name` | The user's full name, as specified by the identity provider. |

:::info Validating "aud" and "iss" claims

The `aud` claim defines what application the JWT is intended for. Pomerium sets the `aud` claim to be the domain of the target upstream application.

Since v0.22, Pomerium sets the `iss` claim also to the domain of the target upstream application. (In previous versions, this was instead set to the authentication service domain.)

Upstream services should verify that these claims match the expected domain in order to prevent token reuse between different upstream services.

:::

### JWT Settings

Use these settings to configure Pomerium to forward the Pomerium JWT to upstream services:

- [Pass Identity Headers (global)](/docs/reference/pass-identity-headers)
- [Pass Identity Headers (per route)](/docs/reference/routes/pass-identity-headers-per-route)

If your identity provider provides other claims not included in the Pomerium JWT that you would like to pass to your application, you can use the [JWT Claims Headers](/docs/reference/jwt-claim-headers) option to include them in the JWT as well.
