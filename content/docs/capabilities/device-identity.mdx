title: Device Identity
description: Learn about how WebAuthn is used to authenticate and authorize access using Device ID and state.

One of the core components of the zero trust security model is **device identity**, which is the ability for a device to have a unique, unclonable identity string that can be authenticated and factored into access control decisions. This topic page covers the concept of device identity, and how it applies to the zero trust model.

## Implement Device Identity with Pomerium

Pomerium supports policies that use device identity since version [0.16.0](/docs/overview/upgrading#policy-for-device-identity). We use the [Web Authentication][webauthn-api] (**WebAuthN**) API to bring authentication and authorization based on device identity into your security framework. Pomerium's device identity support enables users to register their devices, and administrators to enforce access to applications and services to a particular set of trusted devices.

To get started, review the following pages:

- [Pomerium Policy Language](/docs/topics/ppl) to learn how to build policies that use device ID.
- **End Users** should review [Enroll a Device](/docs/guides/enroll-device) to learn how to enroll devices on Pomerium. In Enterprise environments, self-enrollments must be approved by an admin in the Enterprise Console.
- **Enterprise Administrators** can review the [Devices](/docs/enterprise/reference/manage#devices) reference material to create pre-approved enrollment links for users.
- [pomerium/webauthn](https://github.com/pomerium/webauthn) on GitHub, our implementation of the WebAuthn specification.

## Looking Ahead: Device Posture

Even if access is restricted to known devices, what happens when a user is found to have a vulnerable OS or browser version? How can an administrator ensure their network is not exposed, and that the user's system is promptly patched and remediated? As secure enclave technologies evolve, **device posture** -- which is sometimes referred to as device state -- will play an increasingly important role in not only authorization decisions but also in helping to quickly remediate vulnerable corporate devices. Device posture is a more complex superset of device identity, with more information about the device and software being used to generate the resulting identifier.

Designing your security model to use device identity also primes your infrastructure to implement advanced security rules based on device posture down the road.
