description: Learn about how WebAuthn is used to authenticate and authorize access using Device ID and state.

:::tip

This article describes a use case available to [Pomerium Enterprise](/docs/enterprise/about) customers.

:::

One of the core components of the zero trust security model is **device identity**, which is the ability for a device to have a unique, unclonable identity string that can be authenticated and factored into access control decisions. This topic page covers the concept of device identity, and how it applies to the zero trust model.

## Implement Device Identity with Pomerium

Pomerium supports policies that use device identity since version [0.16.0](/docs/overview/upgrading#policy-for-device-identity). We use the [Web Authentication][webauthn-api] (**WebAuthN**) API to bring authentication and authorization based on device identity into your security framework. Pomerium's device identity support enables users to register their devices, and administrators to enforce access to applications and services to a particular set of trusted devices.

To get started, review the following pages:

- [Pomerium Policy Language](/docs/topics/ppl) to learn how to build policies that use device ID.
- **End Users** should review [Enroll a Device](/docs/guides/enroll-device) to learn how to enroll devices on Pomerium. In Enterprise environments, self-enrollments must be approved by an admin in the Enterprise Console.
- **Enterprise Administrators** can review the [Devices](/docs/enterprise/reference/manage#devices) reference material to create pre-approved enrollment links for users.
- [pomerium/webauthn](https://github.com/pomerium/webauthn) on GitHub, our implementation of the WebAuthn specification.
