# Pomerium Policy Language

Pomerium Policy Language (**PPL**) is a [yaml]-based notation for creating easy and flexible authorization policies. This document covers the usage of PPL and provides several example policies.

PPL allows administrators to express authorization policy in a high-level, declarative language that promotes safe, performant, fine-grained controls.

:::note

See the [**Policy setting**](/docs/reference/routes/policy) page to learn how to apply a PPL policy to a route.

:::

## At a Glance

Each PPL policy has at the top level a set of `allow` or `deny` actions, with a list of logical operators, criteria, matchers, and values underneath. For example:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - domain:
        is: example.com
    - user:
        is: user1@example.com
deny:
  or:
    - user:
        is: user2@example.com
    - user:
        is: user3@example.com
```

This policy will allow a user with an email address at `example.com` who **is also** `user`. It will deny `user2` **or** `user3`, regardless of their domain and group membership.

## Rules

A PPL document is either an object or an array of objects. The object represents a rule where the action is the key and the value is an object containing the logical operators.

## Actions

Only two actions are supported: `allow` and `deny`. `deny` takes precedence over `allow`. More precisely: a user will have access to a route if **at least one** `allow` rule matches and **no** `deny` rules match.

## Logical Operators

A logical operator combines multiple criteria together for the evaluation of a rule. There are 4 logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not` and `nor`.

Given the following example with `OPERATOR` replaced:

```yaml
allow:
  OPERATOR:
    - domain:
        is: example.com
    - claim/groups: admin
```

If `and` is used, the user will have access if their email address ends in `example.com` **and** they are a member of the admin group. **(A ∧ B)**

If `or` is used, the user will have access if their email address ends in `example.com` **or** they are a member of the admin group. **(A ∨ B)**

If `not` is used, the user will have access if their email address does not end in `example.com` **and** they are not a member of the `admin` group. **(¬A ∧ ¬B) = ¬(A ∨ B)** (This operation is traditionally called **NOR** in the Boolean algebra.)

If `nor` is used, the user will have access if their email address does not end in `example.com` **or** they are not a member of the admin group. **(¬A ∨ ¬B) = ¬(A ∧ B)** (This operation is traditionally called **NAND** in the Boolean algebra.)

  </div>
</details>

### Multiple Operators in a Rule

You _can_ add multiple operators under the same rule, and it would be valid PPL.

For example, this policy would grant access to anyone with a `family_name: Smith` claim, **or** users with email addresses ending in `domain1` or `domain2`:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - claim/family_name: Smith
  or:
    - domain:
        is: domain1.com
    - domain:
        is: domain2.com
```

However, you could write an equivalent policy with multiple `allow` blocks:

```yaml
- allow:
    and:
      - claim/family_name: Smith
- allow:
    or:
      - domain:
          is: domain1.com
      - domain:
          is: domain2.com
```

Although these policies are equally effective, we recommend using just one operator per rule.

## Criteria

Criteria in PPL are represented as an object where the key is the name and optional sub-path of the criterion, and the value changes depending on which criterion is used. A sub-path is indicated with a `/` in the name:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - claim/family_name: Smith
deny:
  not:
    - http_method:
        is: GET
```

### Supported PPL Criteria

Below is an exhaustive list of PPL criteria.

Entries marked with `*` denote criteria that are only available in the [Enterprise Console](/docs/deploy/enterprise) PPL builder. All other entries are available in both Pomerium Core and Pomerium Enterprise.

| Criterion Name | Data Format | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `accept` | Anything. Typically `true`. | Always returns true, thus always allowing access. Equivalent to the [`allow_public_unauthenticated_access`] option. |
| `authenticated_user` | Anything. Typically `true`. | Always returns true for logged-in users. Equivalent to the [`allow_any_authenticated_user`] option. |
| `claim` | Anything. Typically a string. | Returns true if a token claim matches the supplied value **exactly**. The claim to check is determined via the sub-path. <br/> For example, `claim/family_name: Smith` matches if the user's `family_name` claim is `Smith`. |
| `client_certificate` | [Certificate matcher] | Returns true if a client presented a TLS certificate matching the provided condition. |
| `cors_preflight` | Anything. Typically `true`. | Returns true if the incoming request uses the `OPTIONS` method and has both the `Access-Control-Request-Method` and `Origin` headers. Used to allow [CORS pre-flight requests]. |
| \* `date` | [Date Matcher] | Returns true if the time of the request matches the constraints. |
| \* `day_of_week` | [Day of Week Matcher] | Returns true if the day of the request matches the constraints. |
| `device` | [Device matcher] | Returns true if the incoming request includes a valid device ID or type. |
| `domain` | [String Matcher] | Returns true if the logged-in user's email address domain (the part after `@`) matches the given value. |
| `email` | [String Matcher] | Returns true if the logged-in user's email address matches the given value. |
| \* `groups` | [String List Matcher] | Returns true if a user's group ID matches the supplied value **exactly**. `groups` data is only available after a successful directory sync. See [Identity Providers](/docs/identity-providers) for vendor-specific directory sync steps. |
| `http_method` | [String Matcher] | Returns true if the HTTP method matches the given value. |
| `http_path` | [String Matcher] | Returns true if the HTTP path matches the given value. |
| `invalid_client_certificate` | Anything. Typically `true`. | Returns true if the incoming request does not have a trusted client certificate. By default, a `deny` rule using this criterion is added to all Pomerium policies when [downstream mTLS] is configured (but this default can be changed using the [Enforcement Mode](/docs/reference/downstream-mtls-settings#enforcement-mode) setting.) |
| `pomerium_routes` | Anything. Typically `true`. | Returns true if the incoming request is for the special `.pomerium` routes. A default `allow` rule using this criterion is added to all Pomerium policies. |
| \* `record` | variable | Allows policies to be extended using data from [external data sources](/docs/integrations) |
| `reject` | Anything. Typically `true`. | Always returns false. The opposite of `accept`. |
| \* `time_of_day` | [Time of Day Matcher] | Returns true if the time of the request (for the current day) matches the constraints. |
| `user` | [String Matcher] | Returns true if the logged-in user's id matches the given value. |

Entries marked with `*` denote criteria that are only available in the [Enterprise Console](/docs/deploy/enterprise) PPL builder. All other entries are available in both Pomerium Core and Pomerium Enterprise.

## Matchers

### Certificate Matcher

:::caution

The certificate matcher is a beta feature. The syntax and capabilities are subject to change in a future Pomerium release.

:::

A certificate matcher can be used to allow or deny specific TLS certificates, based on either the certificate fingerprint or Subject Public Key Info (SPKI) hash. This matcher is represented as an object that may have the following key/value entries:

| Key Name | Value Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fingerprint` | string or array of strings | The certificate's SHA-256 fingerprint must match one of the provided values. |
| `spki_hash` | string or array of strings | The base64-encoded SHA-256 hash of the certificate's Subject Public Key Info must match one of the provided values. |

<details>
<summary>Notes on certificate fingerprint</summary>

The certificate fingerprint is a SHA-256 hash of the entire certificate. You can compute a certificate's fingerprint using the `openssl` command:

```shell-session
$ openssl x509 -in path/to/certificate.pem -noout -fingerprint -sha256
sha256 Fingerprint=17:85:92:73:E8:A9:80:63:1D:36:7B:2D:5A:6A:66:35:41:2B:0F:22:83:5F:69:E4:7B:3F:65:62:45:46:A7:04
```

This is the "long" form of a certificate fingerprint (32 uppercase hexadecimal bytes separated by colons). A "short" form is also acceptable (32 lowercase hexadecimal bytes, without colons). You can also compute this form using the `openssl` command:

```shell-session
$ openssl x509 -in path/to/certificate.pem -outform DER | openssl dgst -sha256
SHA2-256(stdin)= 17859273e8a980631d367b2d5a6a6635412b0f22835f69e47b3f65624546a704
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Notes on SPKI hash</summary>

The SPKI hash is a base64-encoded SHA-256 hash of the Subject Public Key Info section of the certificate. You can compute a certificate's SPKI hash using a sequence of `openssl` commands:

```shell-session
$ openssl x509 -in path/to/certificate.pem -noout -pubkey \
  | openssl pkey -pubin -outform DER \
  | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary \
  | openssl enc -base64
FsDbM0rUYIiL3V339eIKqiz6HPSB+Pz2WeAWhqlqh8U=
```

The advantage of using the SPKI hash rather than the certificate fingerprint is that the SPKI hash may be stable across certificate renewals (if the public/private key pair is the same).

</details>

For example, to allow only one specific trusted certificate (while still requiring the user to sign in with the configured identity provider):

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - authenticated_user: true
    - client_certificate:
        fingerprint: '17859273e8a980631d367b2d5a6a6635412b0f22835f69e47b3f65624546a704'
```

Or, to enforce an allowlist of trusted certificate key pairs (again, while still requiring users to sign in with the configured identity provider):

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - authenticated_user: true
    - client_certificate:
        spki_hash:
          - 'FsDbM0rUYIiL3V339eIKqiz6HPSB+Pz2WeAWhqlqh8U='
          - 'pbdFxDXEtpabt3MZiik71farokMg6ZIn2azvsdXtZYA='
          - 'WTu9ETBS1/v/ll20erWcf+TAj7rzrJix/oCUv5GMPtg='
            ...
```

### Day of Week Matcher

The day of week matcher is a **string**. The string can either be `*`, a comma-separated list of days, or a dash-separated list of days.

- `*` matches all days.
- `,` matches either day (e.g. `mon,wed,fri`).
- `-` matches a range of days. (e.g. `mon-fri`). Days can be specified as English full day names, or as 3 character abbreviations. For example:

  ```yaml
  allow:
    and:
      - day_of_week: tue-fri
  ```

### Date Matcher

The date matcher is an object with operators as keys. It supports the following operators: `after` and `before`. The values are [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date strings. `after` means that the time of the request must be after the supplied date and `before` means that the time of the request must be before the supplied date. For example:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - date:
        after: 2020-01-02T16:20:00
        before: 2150-01-02T16:20:00
```

### Device Matcher

A device matcher is an object with operators as keys. It supports the following operators:

- `is` - an exact match of the device ID.
- `approved` - true if the device has been approved. This is an enterprise-only feature.
- `type` - Specifies the type of device to match on. The available types are `enclave_only` and `any`.
  - `enclave_only` will only match [platform authenticators](/docs/concepts/device-identity#secure-enclaves). These include TPM modules and hardware-backed keystores built into mobile devices.
  - `any` will also match [hardware security keys](/docs/concepts/device-identity#hardware-security-keys).

For example, a policy to allow any user with a registered device:

```yaml
- allow:
    or:
      - device:
          type: any
```

Compare to a policy that only allows a set of specific devices:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
- allow:
    or:
      - device:
          is: "5Vn3...C1RS"
      - device:
          is: "GAtL...doqu"
```

:::tip

Users can [find their device IDs](/docs/capabilities/device-identity#find-device-id) at the `/.pomerium` endpoint from any route.

:::

### String Matcher

A string matcher is an object with operators as keys. It supports the following operators: `contains`, `ends_with`, `is` and `starts_with`.

For example:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - email:
        starts_with: 'admin@'
```

Or:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - record:
        type: example.com/geoip
        field: country
        is: 'US'
```

### String List Matcher

A string list matcher is an object that supports a single `has` operator as a key. The `has` operator checks that a given string is present in a list of strings.

The `groups` and `record` criteria both support the `has` operator.

For example, using the `groups` criterion:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - groups:
        has: '00gv40ki4gmtCyl5d4x6'
```

Using the `record` criterion:

```yaml
- record:
    type: example.com/hr_user
    field: departments
    has: 'engineering'
```

### Time of Day Matcher

The time of day matcher is an object with operators as keys. It supports the following operators: `timezone`, `after`, and `before`.

`timezone` is required and specifies the timezone to use when interpreting the supplied times. It is recommended to use city names (like `America/Phoenix`) instead of standard timezone abbreviations because standard timezones change throughout the year (i.e. EST becomes EDT and back again).

`after` means the time of the request must be after the supplied time and `before` means that the time of the request must be before the supplied time. For example:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - time_of_day:
        timezone: UTC
        after: 2:20:00
        before: 4:30PM
```
