# Pomerium Policy Language

Pomerium Policy Language (**PPL**) is a [yaml]-based notation for creating easy and flexible authorization policies. This document covers the usage of PPL and provides several example policies.

PPL allows administrators to express authorization policy in a high-level, declarative language that promotes safe, performant, fine-grained controls.

## At a Glance

Each PPL policy has at the top level a set of `allow` or `deny` actions, with a list of logical operators, criteria, matchers, and values underneath. For example:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - domain:
        is: example.com
    - user:
        is: user1@example.com
deny:
  or:
    - user:
        is: user2@example.com
    - user:
        is: user3@example.com
```

This policy will allow a user with an email address at `example.com` who **is also** `user`. It will deny `user2` **or** `user3`, regardless of their domain and group membership.

## Rules

A PPL document is either an object or an array of objects. The object represents a rule where the action is the key and the value is an object containing the logical operators.

## Actions

Only two actions are supported: `allow` and `deny`. `deny` takes precedence over `allow`. More precisely: a user will have access to a route if **at least one** `allow` rule matches and **no** `deny` rules match.

## Logical Operators

A logical operator combines multiple criteria together for the evaluation of a rule. There are 4 logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not` and `nor`.

Given the following example with `OPERATOR` replaced:

```yaml
allow:
  OPERATOR:
    - domain:
        is: example.com
    - claim/groups: admin
```

If `and` is used, the user will have access if their email address ends in `example.com` **and** they are a member of the admin group. **(A ∧ B)**

If `or` is used, the user will have access if their email address ends in `example.com` **or** they are a member of the admin group. **(A ∨ B)**

If `not` is used, the user will have access if their email address does not end in `example.com` **and** they are not a member of the `admin` group. **(¬A ∧ ¬B)**

If `nor` is used, the user will have access if their email address does not end in `example.com` **or** they are not a member of the admin group. **(¬A ∨ ¬B)**

  </div>
</details>

## Criteria

Criteria in PPL are represented as an object where the key is the name and optional sub-path of the criterion, and the value changes depending on which criterion is used. A sub-path is indicated with a `/` in the name:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - claim/family_name: Smith
deny:
  not:
    - http_method:
        is: GET
```

PPL supports many different criteria:

| Criterion Name | Data Format | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `accept` | Anything. Typically `true`. | Always returns true, thus always allowing access. Equivalent to the [`allow_public_unauthenticated_access`] option. |
| `authenticated_user` | Anything. Typically `true`. | Always returns true for logged-in users. Equivalent to the [`allow_any_authenticated_user`] option. |
| `claim` | Anything. Typically a string. | Returns true if a token claim matches the supplied value **exactly**. The claim to check is determined via the sub-path. <br/> For example, `claim/family_name: Smith` matches if the user's `family_name` claim is `Smith`. |
| `cors_preflight` | Anything. Typically `true`. | Returns true if the incoming request uses the `OPTIONS` method and has both the `Access-Control-Request-Method` and `Origin` headers. Used to allow [CORS pre-flight requests]. |
| `device` | [Device matcher] | Returns true if the incoming request includes a valid device ID or type. |
| `domain` | [String Matcher] | Returns true if the logged-in user's email address domain (the part after `@`) matches the given value. |
| `email` | [String Matcher] | Returns true if the logged-in user's email address matches the given value. |
| `http_method` | [String Matcher] | Returns true if the HTTP method matches the given value. |
| `http_path` | [String Matcher] | Returns true if the HTTP path matches the given value. |
| `invalid_client_certificate` | Anything. Typically `true`. | Returns true if the incoming request has an invalid client certificate. A default `deny` rule using this criterion is added to all Pomerium policies when an mTLS [client certificate authority] is set. |
| `pomerium_routes` | Anything. Typically `true`. | Returns true if the incoming request is for the special `.pomerium` routes. A default `allow` rule using this criterion is added to all Pomerium policies. |
| `reject` | Anything. Typically `true`. | Always returns false. The opposite of `accept`. |
| `user` | [String Matcher] | Returns true if the logged-in user's id matches the given value. |

[Pomerium Enterprise] supports all the open source criteria, but also supports these additional criteria:

| Criterion Name | Data Format | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `date` | [Date Matcher] | Returns true if the time of the request matches the constraints. |
| `day_of_week` | [Day of Week Matcher] | Returns true if the day of the request matches the constraints. |
| `time_of_day` | [Time of Day Matcher] | Returns true if the time of the request (for the current day) matches the constraints. |
| `record` | variable | Allows policies to be extended using data from [external data sources](/docs/integrations) |

## Matchers

### Day of Week Matcher

The day of week matcher is a **string**. The string can either be `*`, a comma-separated list of days, or a dash-separated list of days.

- `*` matches all days.
- `,` matches either day (e.g. `mon,wed,fri`).
- `-` matches a range of days. (e.g. `mon-fri`). Days can be specified as English full day names, or as 3 character abbreviations. For example:

  ```yaml
  allow:
    and:
      - day_of_week: tue-fri
  ```

### Date Matcher

The date matcher is an object with operators as keys. It supports the following operators: `after` and `before`. The values are [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date strings. `after` means that the time of the request must be after the supplied date and `before` means that the time of the request must be before the supplied date. For example:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - date:
        after: 2020-01-02T16:20:00
        before: 2150-01-02T16:20:00
```

### Device Matcher

A device matcher is an object with operators as keys. It supports the following operators:

- `is` - an exact match of the device ID.
- `approved` - true if the device has been approved. This is an enterprise-only feature.
- `type` - Specifies the type of device to match on. The available types are `enclave_only` and `any`.
  - `enclave_only` will only match [platform authenticators](/docs/concepts/device-identity#secure-enclaves). These include TPM modules and hardware-backed keystores built into mobile devices.
  - `any` will also match [hardware security keys](/docs/concepts/device-identity#hardware-security-keys).

For example, a policy to allow any user with a registered device:

```yaml
- allow:
    or:
      - device:
          type: any
```

Compare to a policy that only allows a set of specific devices:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
- allow:
    or:
      - device:
          is: "5Vn3...C1RS"
      - device:
          is: "GAtL...doqu"
```

:::tip

Users can [find their device IDs](/docs/capabilities/device-identity#find-device-id) at the `/.pomerium` endpoint from any route.

### String Matcher

A string matcher is an object with operators as keys. It supports the following operators: `contains`, `ends_with`, `is` and `starts_with`. For example:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - email:
        starts_with: 'admin@'
```

### Time of Day Matcher

The time of day matcher is an object with operators as keys. It supports the following operators: `timezone`, `after`, and `before`.

`timezone` is required and specifies the timezone to use when interpreting the supplied times. It is recommended to use city names (like `America/Phoenix`) instead of standard timezone abbreviations because standard timezones change throughout the year (i.e. EST becomes EDT and back again).

`after` means the time of the request must be after the supplied time and `before` means that the time of the request must be before the supplied time. For example:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - time_of_day:
        timezone: UTC
        after: 2:20:00
        before: 4:30PM
```
