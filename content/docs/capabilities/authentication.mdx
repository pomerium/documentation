# Authentication / SSO

While Pomerium itself is not an identity provider, Pomerium does integrate with your existing single-sign-on Identity Provider (**IdP**) of choice. Pomerium uses your IdP to add authentication, single-sign-on, and identity context to all upstream applications even if the app itself doesn't directly support single-sign-on, which is great for legacy apps.

Pomerium supports any identity provider that uses the open standard [OpenID Connect][openid connect] (**OIDC**). In addition to (OIDC), Pomerium supports most well known identity providers specifically, and Pomerium Enterprise users are able to leverage full directory sync for even more context around things like roles, groups, and whatever other relevant user identity context which exists in your directory.
