The Pomerium Routes Portal allows a user to see all the routes they have access to and easily navigate or connect to them.
The Routes Portal is personalized for each user based their authorization to the configured routes.
For non-HTTP routes, such as SSH or plain TCP connections, the portal provides corresponding Pomerium CLI commands that can be used to connect to the resources.

We recommend using the Routes Portal to help onboard new users to Pomerium and to provide a central location for users to access all their resources.

## Ways of Accessing the Routes Portal

The Routes Portal is available in the following ways:
* [**Web Page**](#web-page) - Generally useful for quickly navigating to available web applications or identifying non-HTTP CLI commands
* [**Desktop Client**](#desktop-client) - Best for setting up non-HTTP connections such as SSH or databases
* [**CLI**](#cli) - Can be used programmatically to list routes and then connect to them
* [**JSON API**](#json-api) - Can be used to integrate with your own systems and processes

:::note Identifying Your Pomerium Domain
The Routes Portal is available on all Pomerium cluster domains.
New users should contact their Pomerium administrator to identify their organization's Pomerium domain.
The domain could be a Pomerium provided domain such as `curious-cat-9999.pomerium.app` or a custom domain.
:::

### Web Page

The web page version of the Routes Portal is accessible via a web browser at `https://<your-pomerium-domain>/.pomerium/routes`.
Accessing the page when not authenticated will redirect you to the configured Identity Provider for authentication.
Once logged in, you will see a list of all the routes you have access to.

### Desktop Client

The Pomerium Desktop Client can automatically create connections using the Routes Portal.
While static route lists can be exported, shared, and imported by users looking to set up their Pomerium Desktop Client, the portal provides a more dynamic way of loading available route configuration.
After providing your Pomerium cluster domain, the Desktop Client will automatically load all the routes you have access to.
You may optionally specific a tag for the loaded routes to identify the ones created by this process.

:::note Updating Routes in the Desktop Client
The Desktop Client does not automatically update the routes list when changes are made to the Pomerium configuration.
An updated routes list can be loaded by performing the same process again.
