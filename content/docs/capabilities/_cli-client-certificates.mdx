### Client Certificates

If Pomerium is configured to require client certificates, you will also need to provide a client certificate and private key when invoking the `pomerium-cli` command.

You can specify these either by using PEM files, or (new in [v0.23.0](https://github.com/pomerium/cli/releases/tag/v0.23.0)) by searching for a certificate in the system trust store (on **macOS** and **Windows** only).

To specify a client certificate and key using PEM files:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
  {`pomerium-cli ${props.protocol} --client-cert cert.pem --client-key key.pem  route.corp.example.com:1234`}
</CodeBlock>

To search for a client certificate in the system trust store:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
  {`pomerium-cli ${props.protocol} --client-cert-from-store route.corp.example.com:1234`}
</CodeBlock>

This will search the Keychain (on macOS) or the Windows certificate store (on Windows) for a client certificate and private key, based on the trusted CA names advertised by Pomerium in the TLS handshake.

If you need to select between multiple matching client certificates, you can additionally filter based on the Distinguished Name of the certificate's Issuer and/or the certificate Subject.

For example, to filter for a certificate directly issued by a CA with the Common Name "My Trusted CA":

<CodeBlock language="bash">
  {`pomerium-cli ${props.protocol} --client-cert-from-store --client-cert-issuer "CN=My Trusted CA" route.corp.example.com:1234`}
</CodeBlock>

Or, to filter for a certificate whose Subject contains the Organizational Unit Name "My Department":

<CodeBlock language="bash">
  {`pomerium-cli ${props.protocol} --client-cert-from-store --client-cert-subject "OU=My Department" route.corp.example.com:1234`}
</CodeBlock>

See the [reference page](/docs/capabilities/tcp/reference#certificate-name-filters) for more details about the certificate name filter syntax.
