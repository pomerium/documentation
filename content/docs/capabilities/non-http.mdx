# Non-HTTP Protocols

Pomerium supports tunneling **non-HTTP protocols** (such as TCP- and UDP-based services) over HTTP, allowing you to secure and authenticate connections to those services using your existing identity provider.

Common uses include:

- Administrative connections (SSH, RDP)
- Data services (Redis, MySQL, Postgres)
- UDP-based protocols (e.g., time servers, Factorio game server)

Below, you'll find details on how it works, how to create routes, and how to use the Pomerium CLI or Desktop client to connect.

## How It Works

Pomerium uses HTTP tunneling methods described in relevant RFCs:

- **TCP**: Uses the [`CONNECT`](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#CONNECT) method to establish a tunnel.
- **UDP**: Uses [`CONNECT-UDP`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9298) to tunnel UDP traffic over HTTP/2 or HTTP/3.

:::caution

To minimize issues with TCP support, **do not** place Pomerium behind another HTTP proxy.  
Instead, configure your load balancer in L4/TCP mode. If you must proxy HTTP to Pomerium, the upstream proxy must support forwarding `CONNECT` or `CONNECT-UDP` traffic.

## Configure TCP Routes

TCP configuration is simple. Just specify the correct scheme and ports in your route [`to`](/docs/reference/routes/to) and [`from`](/docs/reference/routes/from) fields.

Example:

```yaml
routes:
  - from: tcp+https://redis.corp.example.com:6379
    to: tcp://redis.internal.example.com:6379
    policy:
      - allow:
          or:
            - email:
                is: contractor@not-example.com
            - claim/groups: 'datascience@example.com'
```

When creating TCP routes, note the following:

- When configuring a TCP route, any HTTP specific settings such as `regex_rewrite_pattern` or `set_request_headers` have no effect.
- While data is encrypted from a user system to Pomerium's proxy, the underlying application protocol must also support encryption for data to be fully encrypted end-to-end. Otherwise, traffic from the Pomerium Proxy service to the upstream service will be unencrypted.
- The ports in `from` and `to` are independent. Users only need to know the `from` URL to connect. The `to` can be changed without end user participation.
- The port defined in `from` does not dictate what port the tunneled traffic uses. This will always be the port defined by [`address`](/docs/reference/address) in your Pomerium configuration (`443` by default). The port instead differentiates multiple routes to the same hostname for different services.

## Connect to TCP Routes

While HTTP routes can be consumed with just a normal browser, `pomerium-cli` or Pomerium Desktop must serve as a proxy for TCP routes. See [Pomerium Desktop and CLI Clients](/docs/deploy/clients) for more information.

To connect, you normally need just the external hostname and port of your TCP route:

```shell-session
$ pomerium-cli tcp redis.localhost.pomerium.io:6739
2023/10/02 11:19:59 listening on 127.0.0.1:52046
```

By default, `pomerium-cli` will start a listener on loopback on a random port.

On first connection, you will be sent through a standard Pomerium HTTP authentication flow. After completing this, your TCP connection should be established!

```shell-session
$ redis-cli -h localhost -p 52046
localhost:52046> keys *
(empty array)
localhost:52046>
```

## Advanced TCP capabilities

### Listen configuration

You may specify an optional address and port for the `tcp` command to listen on.

`-` specifies that STDIN and STDOUT should be directly attached to the remote TCP connection. This is useful for [SSH](./examples/ssh#tunnel-and-connect-simultaneously) or for sending data through a shell pipe.

### Bastion host

If the Pomerium proxy is not reachable through port `443` or the route is not in external DNS, you can use Pomerium as a bastion host using the extended TCP URL syntax in your route definition:

```yaml
from: tcp+https://proxy.corp.example.com:8443/redis.internal.example.com:6379
```

And then using the same URL in the pomerium-cli command invocation:

```bash
pomerium-cli tcp tcp+https://proxy.corp.example.com:8443/redis.internal.example.com:6379
```

The command above connects to `https://pomerium.corp.example.com:8443` and then requests the TCP route for `redis.internal.example.com:6379`.

<CLIClientCertificates protocol="tcp" />

### Proxy chaining support

The TCP route example above uses a `to` URL with the scheme `tcp://`. For a TCP route like this, Pomerium will open a raw TCP connection to the upstream service.

Alternatively, you can configure a TCP route to proxy an HTTP CONNECT request to the upstream service. This is useful if you want to place another HTTP-to-TCP proxy behind Pomerium.

To configure Pomerium to chain TCP connection requests:

```yaml
routes:
  - from: tcp+https://example.corp.com:10002
    to: http://second-proxy.example.corp.com:10003
```
