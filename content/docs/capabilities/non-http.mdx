# Non-HTTP Protocols

Pomerium supports tunneling **non-HTTP protocols** (such as TCP- and UDP-based services) over HTTP, allowing you to secure and authenticate connections to those services using your existing identity provider.

Common uses include:

- Administrative connections (SSH, RDP)
- Data services (Redis, MySQL, Postgres)
- UDP-based protocols (e.g., time servers, Factorio game server)

Below, you'll find details on how it works, how to create routes, and how to use the Pomerium CLI or Desktop client to connect.

## How It Works

Pomerium uses HTTP tunneling methods described in relevant RFCs:

- **TCP**: Uses the [`CONNECT`](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#CONNECT) method to establish a tunnel.
- **UDP**: Uses [`CONNECT-UDP`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9298) to tunnel UDP traffic over HTTP/2 or HTTP/3.

:::caution

To minimize issues with TCP support, **do not** place Pomerium behind another HTTP proxy.  
Instead, configure your load balancer in L4/TCP mode. If you must proxy HTTP to Pomerium, the upstream proxy must support forwarding `CONNECT` or `CONNECT-UDP` traffic.
