# Authorization Policy

An authorization policy defines what resources a user or group can access within an organization. When applying an authorization policy, factors like access management to on-premises or cloud services, authentication flows, and device identity introduce complexity that only scales with organization size.

Pomerium meets you where you are by allowing you to configure granular policies that support or extend your existing policies on a per-route, per-request basis.

## Pomerium authorization policy

You can apply policies in Pomerium to [Namespaces](/docs/capabilities/namespacing) or [Routes](/docs/capabilities/routing).

### Namespaces

:::enterprise

Namespace support is available only for [Enterprise customers](https://www.pomerium.com/enterprise-sales/).

:::

Administrators can create a namespace, add users, groups, and routes to it, and configure a policy that applies to that specific namespace.

### Routes

You can build TLS-encrypted routes to upstream applications and configure policy that restricts access based on the policy criteria.

Pomerium Enterprise and Core customers can configure and apply policies to routes.

### Continuous verification

Pomerium continuously evaluates policy on every request.

Policy applied to any route or namespace will enforce authorization checks throughout a session, ensuring that only the intended user with the right context can access a protected resource.

## Apply authorization policy

Pomerium offers three methods to configure and apply policies:

- [Pomerium Policy Language (PPL)](#pomerium-policy-language-ppl)
- [Enterprise Console GUI](#enterprise-console-gui)
- [Rego](/docs/capabilities/rego)

### Pomerium Policy Language (PPL)

[Pomerium Policy Language (PPL)](/docs/capabilities/ppl) is a declarative, YAML-based access control policy language you can use to configure authorization policies.

PPL is intuitive by design and defines policy with one or more rules composed of actions, logical operators, and criteria. Each criterion has a name and corresponding data.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Core" label="Core">

In Pomerium Core, you can build a policy with PPL and apply it to a route in your configuration file:

```yaml title=pomerium-config.yaml
policy:
  - allow:
      or:
        - email:
            is: user@example.com
```

In this example, only a user with the email `user@example.com` can access the target application.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Enterprise" label="Enterprise">

In the Enterprise Console, you can use the **EDITOR** to manually configure policy with PPL:

![Build an authorization policy with PPL in the Enterprise Console](./img/authorization/ppl-edit-policy.png)

In this example, Pomerium will grant a user access if their email address ends in `example.com` and their `groups` ID matches `00gso9nxonHI4YfbM4x6`. Pomerium will deny the user access on Saturdays and Sundays.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Enterprise Console GUI

:::enterprise

The Enterprise Console provides a policy builder GUI so you can build policies and reapply them to multiple routes and namespaces. See our [**Enterprise**](/docs/enterprise) page to learn more.

:::

Use the **BUILDER** tab to build your policy:

![Build policy with Console GUI](./img/authorization/ppl-gui-policy.png)

In this example, a user will have access if their email address ends in `example.com` and their device ID matches the ID in the **Value** field.

#### Reapply policies

Reapply policies as necessary to any route or namespace:

![Reapply policies to multiple routes or namespaces](./img/authorization/apply-policies-to-routes.png)

### Policy overrides

Pomerium Core and Enterprise offer the following options for overriding your authorization policy:

- **Any Authenticated User**: Allows access to a route with this policy attached to any user who can authenticate to your identity provider
- **CORS Preflight**: Allows unauthenticated HTTP OPTIONS requests as per the CORS spec
- **Public Access**: Allows complete, unrestricted access to an associated route (use this setting with caution)

:::note robots.txt behavior

By default, Pomerium serves a **robots.txt** response directly, instructing search engines _not_ to crawl the route domain:

```txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```

For routes with policies that allow public, unauthenticated access, Pomerium _will not_ serve **robots.txt** directly. Instead, Pomerium will proxy requests for `/robots.txt` to the upstream service.

## Manage devices

:::enterprise

[Device identity](/docs/capabilities/device-identity) is an Enterprise feature. Check out our [Enterprise](/docs/enterprise) page to learn more.

:::

The **Manage Devices** feature in the Enterprise Console allows you to enroll and manage user devices for policy-based authorization.

![Enroll devices](./img/authorization/enroll-device.png)

The **Devices List** displays enrolled devices for each user and the approval status. Administrators can inspect, approve, or delete registered devices from this table.
