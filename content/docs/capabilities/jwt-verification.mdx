# JWT verification

Pomerium's [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/pomerium/js-sdk) provides a client-side solution to verify JWTs issued by the authorization service.

## Requirements to use the JavaScript SDK

The JavaScript SDK is available as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pomerium/js-sdk) and can be imported using CommonJS or ECMAScript modules.

To use the JavaScript SDK, you need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 18+)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (to install Node.js and Yarn)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) (preferred package manager)

### Basic usage

The following code provides a minimum working example of how JWT verification works using the JavaScript SDK in a React app:

<ReactApp />

:::tip

See the [JavaScript SDK guide](/docs/guides/js-sdk) for more complete client- and server-side examples using React and Express.

:::

<details>
  <summary>Trust on first use (TOFU)</summary>
  <div>

The `issuer` and `audience` parameters are optional. If you donâ€™t define them, `PomeriumVerifier` applies `firstUse` by default to the JWT provided by the identity provider. `PomeriumVerifier` verifies subsequent requests with these claims.

If you define the `issuer` and `audience` parameters, `PomeriumVerifier` verifies their values against the claims provided by the identity provider.

The `issuer` and `audience` parameters should both be set to the domain of the **upstream application** without the prefixed protocol (for example, `httpbin.corp.example.com`).

  </div>

### PomeriumVerifier reference

The `PomeriumVerifier` class is the easiest way to verify JWTs. See the reference below for more information:

#### Parameters

| Parameters | Description | Value |
| :-- | :-- | --- |
| issuer | The domain of the upstream application (for example, `httpbin.corp.example.com`). | String |
| audience | The same value as `issuer`. | String |
| expirationBuffer | Adds padding in seconds to prevent throwing errors for expired JWTs that may have differing server times. Defaults to `0` | Integer |
| firstUse | Decides whether or not to trust the first JWT. | Boolean |
| jwtData | The JSON payload containing JWT claims. | Object |
| verifiedJwtData | The verified JSON payload containing JWT claims. | Object |

#### Methods

| Method | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| getClientJwt | Fetches client JWT from the `/.pomerium/jwt` endpoint. |
| parseJWT | Decodes JWT token. |
| getJWKsData | Fetches JWKs data from the `/.well-known/pomerium/jwks.json` endpoint. |
| verifyPomeriumJWT | Verifies JWT using the `jwt`, `authenticateBaseUrl`, `issuer`, and `audience` parameters. |
| withHttps | Prepends the URL with the `https://` protocol. |
| signOut | Signs user out and redirects them with the `/.pomerium/sign_out` endpoint. |

## Server-side JWT verification

Pomerium also provides server-side solutions in Go and JavaScript:

- [Go SDK](https://github.com/pomerium/sdk-go)
- [Node/Express JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/pomerium/js-sdk/tree/main/examples/express)
