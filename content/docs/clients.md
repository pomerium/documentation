# Pomerium Core Clients

Pomerium offers optional CLI and Desktop clients:

- [Pomerium CLI](/docs/clients/pomerium-cli)
- [Pomerium Desktop](/docs/clients/pomerium-desktop)

Both the CLI and Desktop clients act as an authentication helper for tools like kubectl and TCP-based connections.

See the [Pomerium Desktop and CLI Clients](/docs/capabilities/tcp/client) page for more information.
