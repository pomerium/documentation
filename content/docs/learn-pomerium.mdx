## Learn Pomerium

Welcome to **Learn Pomerium**, a series of guided tutorials designed to teach you the basics of Pomerium so you can secure your apps with confidence.

These tutorials provide a structured approach to learning how Pomerium works. There are 10 tutorials in all.

Head to [**Get Started**](/docs/learn-pomerium/get-started) to get a Pomerium instance up and running. From there, you'll add on to your configuration file in each tutorial.

Below, we’ve included some background information about Pomerium and reverse proxies (if you're not unfamiliar).

## Reverse Proxies: a Primer

### What is a Reverse Proxy?

A reverse proxy is a server that sits between a client (like your browser) and an application’s origin server. When a client sends a request to an application behind a reverse proxy, the proxy receives the request before forwarding it to the origin server. When the origin server responds, the reverse proxy receives the request before sending it back to the client.

This model affords several benefits:


#### **Security**

Because reverse proxies sit in front of an application’s origin server, the origin server’s IP address is hidden. If a malicious attacker attempts to overload or compromise the origin server, the reverse proxy would be targeted instead.

#### **Load Balancing**

You can use reverse proxies in your load balancing strategy to distribute traffic to available, healthy servers. So, if a website experiences high volumes of traffic, the reverse proxy can distribute traffic to a healthy server so that no single server is overloaded.

#### **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**

TLS encryption is computationally expensive for an origin server. A reverse proxy relieves the burden on the origin server because it can decrypt incoming requests and encrypt outgoing responses.

## Pomerium Architecture

To use Pomerium effectively, it helps to understand how Pomerium communicates with clients, identity providers, and upstream applications.

### Request Lifecycle

This diagram illustrates how Pomerium handles client requests to access upstream applications:

## Pomerium Terminology

You’ll come across a lot of reverse proxy terminology in our documentation and guided tutorials that may not be intuitive or understandable at first.

Below are are a few terms you should know:

- **Resource**, **Asset**, **Application**, or **Service**: These terms all essentially represent the same thing: a sensitive destination within your private network that you want to secure behind Pomerium. We typically try not to use “resource” or “asset” because, well, they can mean different things depending on the context.
- **Downstream** and **Upstream**: Pomerium sits between a client and a web app or service. If Pomerium is in the middle, then the client is “downstream” of Pomerium, and the protected app or service is “upstream” of Pomerium.

See our [Glossary](/docs/internals/glossary) to review more terms.
