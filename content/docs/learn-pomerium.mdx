## Learn Pomerium

Welcome to **Learn Pomerium**, a series of guided tutorials designed to teach you the basics of Pomerium so you can secure your apps with confidence.

These tutorials provide a structured approach to learning how Pomerium works. There are 10 tutorials categorized into the following sections:

- **Part 1:** Set Up Pomerium
- **Part 2:** Pomerium Routes and Policies
- **Part 3:** Authentication with Pomerium
- **Part 4:** Authorization with Pomerium
- **Part 5:** Scaling Pomerium for large-scale use cases

Below, we’ve included some background information about Pomerium and reverse proxies.

## Reverse Proxies: a Primer

### ### What is a Reverse Proxy?

A reverse proxy is a server that sits between a client (like your browser) and a web application’s origin server. The reverse proxy functions as an intermediary between the client and the origin server. If it helps, think of a waiter that brings your order to the kitchen to translate customer orders into kitchen-speak and protect the kitchen from customer contamination.

For example, when you send a request to visit a website that sits behind a reverse proxy:

- The reverse proxy receives the request before forwarding it to the origin server
- The origin server receives the request and sends the appropriate response
- The reverse proxy receives the response and forwards it to the client

This model affords several benefits:

- **Security**

Because reverse proxies sit in front of an application’s origin server, the origin server’s IP is hidden. If a malicious attacker attempts to overload or compromise the origin server, the reverse proxy would receive the request.

- **Load Balancing**

You can use reverse proxies in your load balancing strategy to distribute traffic to available, healthy servers. So, if a website experiences high volumes of traffic, the reverse proxy can distribute traffic to a healthy server so that no single server is overloaded.

- **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**

TLS encryption is computationally expensive for an origin server. A reverse proxy relieves the burden on the origin server because it can decrypt incoming requests and encrypt outgoing responses.

## Pomerium Architecture

As a reverse proxy, Pomerium does a lot! Here’s a high-level breakdown of how Pomerium works:

If that’s a lot, just remember the waiter-kitchen analogy — Pomerium is there to support and protect the kitchen.

## Pomerium Terminology

You’ll come across a lot of reverse proxy terminology in our documentation and guided tutorials that may not be intuitive or understandable at first.

Below is a list of terms you should know:

- **Resource**, **Asset**, **App**, or **Service**: These all essentially represent the same thing: a sensitive destination within your private network that you want to secure behind Pomerium. We typically try not to use “resource” or “asset” because, well, they can mean different things depending on the context.
- **Downstream** and **Upstream**: Pomerium sits between a client and a web app or service. If Pomerium is in the middle, then the client is “downstream” of Pomerium, and the protected app or service is “upstream” of Pomerium.
