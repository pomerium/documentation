# What is Pomerium?

Pomerium builds secure, clientless connections to internal web apps and services without a corporate VPN.

Pomerium is:

- **Easier** because you don’t have to maintain a client or software.
- **Faster** because it’s deployed directly where your apps and services are. No more expensive data backhauling.
- **Safer** because every single action is verified for trusted identity, device, and context.

It’s not a VPN alternative – it’s the trusted, full-proof way to protect your business.

## Why Pomerium?

### [JWT Verification](/docs/capabilities/getting-users-identity)

Pomerium's **JWT Assertion Header** makes it possible to authenticate users and make authorization decisions in upstream applications.

### [Context-aware Access & External Data Sources](/docs/integrations)

Import **External Data Sources** that are unique to your business into your Pomerium instance so you can build context-aware authorization policies.

### Clientless Access

Access protected apps and services without a client or VPN connection. Learn more in the video below.
