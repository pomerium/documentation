# What is Pomerium?

Pomerium is an open source identity-aware proxy built around the principles of [BeyondCorp](https://research.google/pubs/pub43231) and [zero trust](https://www.nist.gov/publications/zero-trust-architecture). It secures your internal applications by continually verifying a user's identity, device state, and context before granting access.

Unlike VPN or tunnel-based approaches, Pomerium provides a scalable, modern alternative that centralizes access policy without requiring client software.

Key benefits:

- **Seamless, clientless access**: No corporate VPN to install or maintain.
- **Granular enforcement**: Every request is authenticated and authorized.
- **Adaptable**: Works across multiple environments (cloud, on-prem, hybrid).
- **Open source pedigree**: Built on the BeyondCorp model. Transparent, with an active community.

## How does it work?

Pomerium intercepts and routes user traffic to protected services through an identity-aware access layer, ensuring every request is validated against your configured identity provider, policies, and device context.

```mermaid

    subgraph Internet
        U((User))
    end

    subgraph Identity
        IdP((Identity Provider))
    end

    subgraph Pomerium
        Proxy(Pomerium Proxy)
        Policy(Policy Engine)
        Proxy --> Policy
    end

    subgraph Internal
        S(Protected Service)
    end

    U -->|Request Access| Proxy
    Proxy -->|Authenticate| IdP
    IdP -->|Return Claims| Proxy
    Policy -->|Allow or Deny| Proxy
    Proxy -->|Forward Request| S
```

In practice:

1. **Authenticate**: Users sign in through your identity provider.
2. **Authorize**: Pomerium checks policies to decide who gets access.
3. **Proxy**: Traffic to internal apps flows through a secure, policy-enforced route.

This approach simplifies managing access to internal servicesâ€”no more network-level trust. Instead, trust is tied to identity, context, and a dynamic access policy.

## Why Pomerium?

- **Streamlined**: No need to juggle separate VPN clients or network ACLs.
- **Future-proof**: Native zero trust posture that's ready for remote work, BYOD, or multi-cloud.
- **Fast**: Deploy where your apps run; no heavy routing or hardware dependencies.
- **Secure by default**: Continuous authentication and authorization ensures only valid requests get through.
