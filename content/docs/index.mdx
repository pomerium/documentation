## What is Pomerium?

Pomerium is an identity-aware proxy that enables secure access to internal applications. Pomerium provides a standardized interface to add access control to applications regardless of whether the application itself has authorization or authentication baked-in. Pomerium gateways both internal and external requests, and can be used in situations where you'd typically reach for a VPN.

### What does it do?

Pomerium can be used to:

- provide a **single-sign-on gateway** to internal applications.
- enforce **dynamic access policy** based on **context**, **identity**, and **device identity**.
- aggregate access logs and telemetry data.
- perform delegated user authorization for service-based authorization systems:
  - [Istio](/docs/guides/istio)
  - [Google Cloud](/docs/guides/cloud-run)
- add unified access and identity to [custom, on-prem, and hosted apps and services](https://www.pomerium.com/integrations/)
- serve as a **VPN alternative**.

### Ok, but show me

You bet.
