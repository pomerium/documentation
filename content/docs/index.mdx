# What is Pomerium?

Pomerium is an identity-aware proxy that enables secure access to internal applications. Pomerium provides a standardized interface to add access control to applications regardless of whether the application itself has authorization or authenticwation baked-in. Pomerium gateways both internal and external requests, and can be used in situations where you'd typically reach for a VPN.

## What does it do?

Pomerium can be used to:

- **authenticate**: provide a **single-sign-on** and **verifiable user identity** to internal applications.
- **authroize**: enforce dynamic access policy based on **context**, **identity**, and **device identity**.
- **audit**: aggregate access logs and telemetry data.
- perform delegated user authorization for service-based authorization systems
- add unified access and identity to [custom, on-prem, and hosted apps and services](https://www.pomerium.com/integrations/)
- serve as a **VPN alternative**.
