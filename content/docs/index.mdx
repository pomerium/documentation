# What is Pomerium?

Pomerium builds secure, clientless connections to internal web apps and services without a corporate VPN.

Pomerium is:

- **Easier** because you don’t have to maintain a client or software.
- **Faster** because it’s deployed directly where your apps and services are. No more expensive data backhauling.
- **Safer** because every single action is verified for trusted identity, device, and context.

It’s not a VPN alternative – it’s the trusted, foolproof way to protect your business.
