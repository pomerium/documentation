import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The $EXT_DATA_PROVIDER integration provides {{Fill me in with content specific to this data provider}}.

:::caution
The external data sources we provide are meant to be examples and inspiration for users to create their own data sources. We won't maintain these integrations in perpetuity, and changes to the APIs they interact with may break them in the future.

The [datasource](https://github.com/pomerium/datasource) project is open-source, and if the community wishes to provide contributions to keep it working in the future, we will shepherd those updates.
