This guide covers using Pomerium to add authentication and authorization to an instance of [TiddlyWiki on NodeJS](https://tiddlywiki.com/static/TiddlyWiki%2520on%2520Node.js.html).

## What is TiddlyWiki on Node.js

TiddlyWiki is a personal wiki and a non-linear notebook for organizing and sharing complex information. It is available in two forms:

- a single HTML page
- [a Node.js application](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiddlywiki)

We are using the Node.js application in this guide.

## Where Pomerium fits

TiddlyWiki allows a simple form of authentication by using authenticated-user-header parameter of [listen command](https://tiddlywiki.com/static/ListenCommand.html). Pomerium provides the ability to login with well-known [identity providers](/docs/identity-providers#identity-provider-configuration).

## Pre-requisites

This guide assumes you have already completed one of the [quick start] guides, and have a working instance of Pomerium up and running. For purpose of this guide, We will use docker-compose, though any other deployment method would work equally well.

## Configure

### Pomerium Config

```yaml title="config.yaml"
jwt_claims_headers: email
routes:
  - from: https://wiki.example.local
    to: http://tiddlywiki:8080
    policy:
      - allow:
          or:
            - email:
                is: reader1@example.com
            - email:
                is: writer1@example.com
```

### Docker-compose

<DockerCompose />

### That's it

Navigate to your TiddlyWiki instance (e.g. `https://wiki.example.local`) and log in:

- as reader1@example.com: user can read the wiki, but there is no create new tiddler button is show up.

- as writer1@example.com: user can read the wiki and create new tiddlers.

- as another email: pomerium displays a permission denied error.
