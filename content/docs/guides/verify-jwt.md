This guide provides several methods to verify and validate the Pomerium JWT forwarded in signed the `X-Pomerium-Jwt-Assertion` header:

- Verification in a [Go application](#verification-in-a-go-application)
- Verification in a [single-page application](#verification-in-a-single-page-application)
- [Manual verification](#manual-verification)

## JWT validation requirements

Before trusting any user identity information in the JWT, your application should verify:

1. The JWT has a valid signature from a trusted source.
2. The JWT has not expired.
3. The JWT audience and issuer match your application's domain.

Signed headers are used to establish an extra layer of authentication. For more information on the benefits, check out our [blog post](https://www.pomerium.com/blog/signed-headers-a-safety-net-for-application-security/) on this topic.

The attestation JWT's signature can be verified using the public key retrieved from Pomerium's `/.well-known/pomerium/jwks.json` endpoint (on any route domain). For example:

```bash
curl https://your-app.corp.example.com/.well-known/pomerium/jwks.json | jq
```

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "use": "sig",
      "kty": "EC",
      "kid": "ccc5bc9d835ff3c8f7075ed4a7510159cf440fd7bf7b517b5caeb1fa419ee6a1",
      "crv": "P-256",
      "alg": "ES256",
      "x": "QCN7adG2AmIK3UdHJvVJkldsUc6XeBRz83Z4rXX8Va4",
      "y": "PI95b-ary66nrvA55TpaiWADq8b3O1CYIbvjqIHpXCY"
    }
  ]
}
```

(This endpoint can also be used to integrate with other systems, such as [Istio](https://istio.io/). For example, see the Istio guide on [Authentication Policy](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/jwt/#JWTRule-jwks_uri), and specifically the [`jwksUri`](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/jwt/#JWTRule-jwks_uri) key on the `jwtRules` mapping.)

:::caution

In order to use the `/.well-known/pomerium/jwks.json` endpoint, you must set either the [Signing Key] or [Signing Key File] configuration option.

:::

After verifying the JWT signature, your application should verify that JWT has not expired, by comparing the current time with the timestamps in the `exp` and `iat` claims. We recommend allowing up to 1 minute leeway in this comparison, to account for clock skew between Pomerium and your application.

And finally, your application should verify that the `aud` and `iss` claim both match the domain used to serve your application.

## Verification in a Go application

For an application written in Go, you can use the [Go SDK](https://github.com/pomerium/sdk-go) to perform the necessary verification steps. For example:

<GoApp />

## Verification in a single-page application

Pomerium's [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/pomerium/js-sdk) provides a client-side solution to verify JWTs issued by the authorization service.

### Requirements to use the JavaScript SDK

The JavaScript SDK is available as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pomerium/js-sdk) and can be imported using CommonJS or ECMAScript modules.

To use the JavaScript SDK, you need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 18+)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (to install Node.js and Yarn)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) (preferred package manager)

The following code provides a minimum working example of how JWT verification works using the JavaScript SDK in a React app:

<ReactApp />

<details>
  <summary>Trust on first use (TOFU)</summary>
  <div>

The `issuer` and `audience` parameters are optional. If you donâ€™t define them, `PomeriumVerifier` applies `firstUse` by default to the JWT provided by the identity provider. `PomeriumVerifier` verifies subsequent requests with these claims.

If you define the `issuer` and `audience` parameters, `PomeriumVerifier` verifies their values against the claims provided by the identity provider.

The `issuer` and `audience` parameters should both be set to the domain of the **upstream application** without the prefixed protocol (for example, `httpbin.corp.example.com`).

  </div>
</details>

### PomeriumVerifier reference

The `PomeriumVerifier` class is the easiest way to verify JWTs. See the reference below for more information:

#### Parameters

| Parameters | Description | Value |
| :-- | :-- | --- |
| issuer | The domain of the upstream application (for example, `httpbin.corp.example.com`). | String |
| audience | The same value as `issuer`. | String |
| expirationBuffer | Adds padding in seconds to prevent throwing errors for expired JWTs that may have differing server times. Defaults to `0` | Integer |
| firstUse | Decides whether or not to trust the first JWT. | Boolean |
| jwtData | The JSON payload containing JWT claims. | Object |
| verifiedJwtData | The verified JSON payload containing JWT claims. | Object |

#### Methods

| Method | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| getClientJwt | Fetches client JWT from the `/.pomerium/jwt` endpoint. |
| parseJWT | Decodes JWT token. |
| getJWKsData | Fetches JWKs data from the `/.well-known/pomerium/jwks.json` endpoint. |
| verifyPomeriumJWT | Verifies JWT using the `jwt`, `authenticateBaseUrl`, `issuer`, and `audience` parameters. |
| withHttps | Prepends the URL with the `https://` protocol. |
| signOut | Signs user out and redirects them with the `/.pomerium/sign_out` endpoint. |

## Manual verification

Though you will likely verify signed headers programmatically in your application's middleware with a third-party JWT library, if you are new to JWT it may be helpful to show what manual verification looks like.

1. Provide Pomerium with a base64-encoded Elliptic Curve ([NIST P-256](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/events/)) Private Key. In production, you'd likely want to get these from your key management service (KMS).

   ```bash
   openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out ec_private.pem
   openssl ec -in ec_private.pem -pubout -out ec_public.pem
   # careful! this will output your private key in terminal
   cat ec_private.pem | base64
   ```

   Copy the base64 encoded value of your private key to Pomerium's environmental configuration variable `SIGNING_KEY`.

   ```bash
   SIGNING_KEY=LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBQUklWQVRFIEtFWS0tLS0tCk1JR0hBZ0VBTUJNR0J5cUdTTTQ5QWdFR0NDcUdTTTQ5QXdFSEJHMHdhd0lCQVFRZzBQdk1VeVZGeWxTbGZ3eDgKSDBxMUVyOHZlOXBnY3ZzNkV6ZnR5OHlxNnFLaFJBTkNBQVM5ZC96TC9aSXd5ZGQ1RXZMb0xGMytHblVIUS9wdQpQaU45NDV1Y1RpTFRqMDhZalo3U0NJV2JHc2tiK0RIMzJ2aUc2KzRnb0FvWlFUM1R6b2kzRVl6OAotLS0tLUVORCBQUklWQVRFIEtFWS0tLS0tCg==
   ```

1. Reload Pomerium. Navigate to httpbin (by default, `https://httpbin.corp.${YOUR-DOMAIN}.com`), and log in as usual. Click **request inspection**. Select `/headers`. Click **try it out** and then **execute**. You should see something like the following.

   ![httpbin displaying jwt headers](./img/jwt/inspect-headers.png)

1. `X-Pomerium-Jwt-Assertion` is the signature value. It's less scary than it looks, and is basically just a compressed, JSON blob as described above. Navigate to [jwt.io], which provides a helpful user interface to manually verify JWT values.

1. Paste the value of `X-Pomerium-Jwt-Assertion` header token into the `Encoded` form. You should notice that the decoded values look much more familiar.

   ![httpbin displaying decoded jwt](./img/jwt/verifying-headers-1.png)

1. Finally, we want to cryptographically verify the validity of the token. To do this, we will need the signer's public key. You can simply copy and paste the output of `cat ec_public.pem`.

   ![httpbin displaying verified jwt](./img/jwt/jwt-payload.png)

**Voila!** Hopefully walking through a manual verification has helped give you a better feel for how signed JWT tokens are used as a secondary validation mechanism in pomerium.

:::caution

In an actual client, you'll want to ensure that all the other claims values are valid (like expiration, issuer, audience and so on) in the context of your application. You'll also want to make sure you have a safe and reliable mechanism for distributing the public signing key to client apps (typically, a [key management service]).
