# Run ToolJet with Docker

Run Pomerium with Docker Compose to secure your ToolJet application.

## What is ToolJet?

[ToolJet](https://www.tooljet.com/) is a self-hosted, low-code platform that helps you build and deploy internal developer tools.

## Why use Pomerium with ToolJet?

Pomerium can secure ToolJet by applying policy to your routes that only grants access to ToolJet to certain users.

ToolJet provides its own RBAC-based [permissions](https://docs.tooljet.com/docs/org-management/permissions) and several [user authentication](https://docs.tooljet.com/docs/category/user-authentication) flows, so proxied requests will require users to sign in twice.

## Before you begin

To complete this guide, you need:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- An [identity provider](/docs/identity-providers)

## Set up Pomerium

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Core" label="Core">

Create a `config.yaml` file and add the following code:

<PomeriumConfig />

Next, you need to:

- Update the IdP configuration variables with your own (See the [GitHub](/docs/identity-providers/github) guide for more information)
- Replace user@example.com with the email associated with your IdP
- Generate a signing key

To generate a [signing key](/docs/reference/signing-key), use the commands below:

```bash
# Generates a P-256 (ES256) signing key
openssl ecparam  -genkey  -name prime256v1  -noout  -out ec_private.pem
# Prints the base64 encoded value of the signing key
cat ec_private.pem | base64
```

Add the base64-encoded signing key to the `signing_key` variable in your `config.yaml` file.

## Add Pomerium services to Docker Compose

Update `docker-compose.yaml` with the following configuration:

<PomeriumCompose />

This configuration also includes the Docker image to run ToolJet.

## Set up ToolJet

In the root folder of your project, create a folder called `postgres_data` to run ToolJet's [in-built PostgreSQL](https://docs.tooljet.com/docs/setup/docker) database:

```bash
mkdir postgres_data
```

Add a `.env` file pre-populated with ToolJet's environment variables:

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToolJet/ToolJet/main/deploy/docker/.env.example
mv .env.example .env
```

In your `.env` file, make the following changes:

- Update `LOCKBOX_MASTER_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY_BASE` following ToolJet's [environment variable](https://docs.tooljet.com/docs/setup/env-vars) docs
- Replace `TOOLJET_HOSTNAME` with your Pomerium [external route](/docs/reference/routes/from) URL instead

For example:

```env
TOOLJET_HOSTNAME=https://tooljet.localhost.pomerium.io
```

Keep the default values for the database configuration and the other environment variables.

## Run ToolJet

Run `docker compose up` to run your Pomerium and ToolJet containers.

In your terminal, wait until ToolJet is in a ready state:

![ToolJet ready state](./img/tooljet/ready-to-use.png)

In your browser, go to the external ToolJet URL to set up your workspace.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Enterprise" label="Enterprise">

:::enterprise Pomerium Enterprise

This guide assumes you can access the [Enterprise Console](/docs/deploy/enterprise/install).

The Docker Compose configuration in the Enterprise portion of this guide uses same implementation as the [Enterprise Quickstart](/docs/deploy/enterprise/quickstart).

:::

The Enterprise Console configuration in this guide consists of three files:

- `config.yaml`
- `console-config.yaml`
- `docker-compose.yaml`

In your `config.yaml` file, add the following code:

<ConfigConsole />

Next, you need to:

- Update the IdP configuration variables with your own (See the [GitHub](/docs/identity-providers/github) guide for more information)
- Replace user@example.com with the email associated with your IdP
- Generate a signing key

To generate a [signing key](/docs/reference/signing-key), use the commands below:

```bash
# Generates a P-256 (ES256) signing key
openssl ecparam  -genkey  -name prime256v1  -noout  -out ec_private.pem
# Prints the base64 encoded value of the signing key
cat ec_private.pem | base64
```

Add the base64-encoded signing key to the `signing_key` variable in your `config.yaml` file.

## Add Console services to Docker Compose

Update your `docker-compose.yaml` file with the following configuration:

<ConsoleCompose />

Add the signing key you generated in `config.yaml` to the `SIGNING_KEY` environment variable.

Add the following configuration settings to `console-config.yaml` and replace the values with your own:

```yaml title=console-config.yaml
administrators: admin@example.com
license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
```

## Set up ToolJet

In the root of your project, create a folder called `postgres_data` to run ToolJet's [in-built PostgreSQL](https://docs.tooljet.com/docs/setup/docker) database:

```bash
mkdir postgres_data
```

Add a `.env` file pre-populated with ToolJet's environment variables:

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToolJet/ToolJet/main/deploy/docker/.env.example
mv .env.example .env
```

In your `.env` file, make the following changes:

- Update `LOCKBOX_MASTER_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY_BASE` following ToolJet's [environment variable](https://docs.tooljet.com/docs/setup/env-vars) docs.
- Replace `TOOLJET_HOSTNAME` with your Pomerium [external route](/docs/reference/routes/from) URL instead.

For example:

```env
TOOLJET_HOSTNAME=https://tooljet.localhost.pomerium.io
```

Keep the default values for the database configuration and the other environment variables.

## Build a route and policy

Run `docker compose up` and go to your Console dashboard.

In your Enterprise Console, create a policy:

1. Name your policy (for example, **tooljet**), then select the **Builder** tab
2. Select **ADD ALLOW BLOCK**, then select the **+** icon to add an **OR** operator
3. In the **Criteria** field, select **Email**
4. In the **Value** field, enter the email address associated with your IdP

![Build a policy](./img/tooljet/add-policy.png)

Save your policy.

Create an external route to access ToolJet:

1. Name your route and enter the external route in the **from:** field
2. Enter the scheme and hostname in the **to:** field
3. In the **Policies** field, select the policy you built for ToolJet
4. Select **Pass Identity Headers**

![Build a route](./img/tooljet/build-route.png)

Configure your route to rewrite the host header:

1. Select **Headers** from the sidebar
2. In the **Host Headers** dropdown, select **Rewrite to Header**
3. In the **Host Rewrite to Header** field, enter the external route without the protocol

![Rewrite headers](./img/tooljet/rewrite-headers.png)

Save your route.

## Access ToolJet from Console

In your terminal, wait until ToolJet is in a ready state:

![ToolJet ready state](./img/tooljet/ready-to-use.png)

In your browser, go to the external ToolJet URL to set up your workspace.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Set up ToolJet workspace

Set up your admin account:

![Set up admin](./img/tooljet/set-up-admin.png)

Set up your workspace:

![Set up ToolJet workspace](./img/tooljet/set-up-workspace.png)

Skip the prompts asking for your company information.

You should now be in your ToolJet dashboard.

### Invite a user

To invite a user:

1. Select **Workspace settings** (the **Gear** icon)
2. In the **Users & Permissions** window, select **Invite new user**
3. Enter their details and select **Create User**
4. Copy their invite link

![Copy invite link](./img/tooljet/invite-url.png)

Open the link in a new tab:

![Join workspace](./img/tooljet/join-workspace.png)

Create a password and accept the invite to log in to the workspace.

From here, you can sign in as an admin and create apps within a workspace, create new workspaces, build apps within a given workspace, and configure workplace permissions to manage access and privileges for users and groups within ToolJet.
