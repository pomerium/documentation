# Secure Browser Access to Code-Server Behind Pomerium Zero

In this guide, you'll run code-server's Visual Studio Code (VSCode) in a Docker container, and secure browser access to your project with Pomerium.

## What is Code-server?

[Code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server) is an open-source tool that allows you to run [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a popular integrated development environment (IDE), on a **remote server** through the browser. This setup essentially turns VSCode into a cloud-based IDE, providing flexibility and accessibility advantages.

Code-server is particularly popular among developers who want the full power of VSCode, but need to work in a cloud-based environment. This is ideal if you work on multiple machines, need to access your development environment remotely, or you have limited local resources.

## How to secure Code-server with Pomerium

Code-server requires [password authentication](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/latest/guide#expose-code-server) by default. By securing code-server behind Pomerium, you can remove code-server’s password requirement and configure Pomerium to add [authentication](/docs/capabilities/authentication) and [authorization](/docs/capabilities/authorization) to an online instance of VSCode.

This guide shows you how to secure code-server with Pomerium. Here are the steps you’ll follow:

1. Install code-server and run it in a Docker container

1. Access your code-server project in the browser listening on `localhost`

1. Configure Pomerium to safely expose your code-server instance

By the end, you will have a minimal, real-world code-server instance that allows developer teams to write code using VSCode in the browser.

### Before you start

This guide uses Docker to run Pomerium Zero and Code-Server services in containers.

To complete this guide, you need:

- A [Pomerium Zero](http://console.pomerium.app/create-account) account
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Configure Pomerium Zero

### Create a policy

In the Zero Console:

1. Go to **Policies**
2. Select **New Policy**
3. Give it a **Name** and an (optional) **Description**
4. Add an **Allow Block** and select an **AND** operator
5. Keep the **Domain** criteria and replace **Value** with the domain portion of your email address (the part after “@”)

Save your policy.

### Create a route

In the Zero Console:

1. Select **Routes**
2. Add a **New Route**
3. Give it a **Name** (like Codeserver)
4. In `From:`, add the external URL to our Codeserver route
5. In `To:`, add the internal URL
6. In the **Policies** field, select the Codeserver policy
7. Select the **Timeouts** tab and **Allow Websockets**

## Add Docker Compose Services

First, make sure your `docker-compose.yaml` file contains the images to run Pomerium Zero and Codeserver:

```yaml {7,14} showLineNumbers
  pomerium:
    image: pomerium/pomerium:v0.27.0
    ports:
      - 443:443
    restart: always
    environment:
      POMERIUM_ZERO_TOKEN: <CLUSTER_TOKEN>
      XDG_CACHE_HOME: /var/cache
    volumes:
      - pomerium-cache:/var/cache
    networks:
      main:
        aliases:
        - authenticate.<CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN>.pomerium.app
  codeserver:
    image: codercom/code-server:latest
    networks:
      main: {}
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    command: --auth none --disable-telemetry /home/coder/project
    volumes:
      - ./code-server:/home/coder/project
      - ./code-server-config/.config:/home/coder/.config
```

In line `7`, replace `CLUSTER_TOKEN` with your own.

In line `14`, replace `CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN` with your own.  For example, if your starter domain is `loquacious-cyborg-2214.pomerium.app`, the URL would be `authenticate.loquacious-cyborg-2214.pomerium.app`.

## Access Code-server

Run `docker compose up` and go to your external URL.

After authenticating against our hosted Identity Provider, Pomerium will redirect you to your code-server instance.

## Build a project in Code-server

Now that you can access VSCode in your browser, test out code-server by building a quick HTML project.

1. Create an `index.html` file and add the following code:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Code-Server Sample</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 style="color:blueviolet">Check out more from Pomerium:</h1>
    <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
      <li><a href="<https://www.pomerium.com/docs/guides>">Guides</a></li>
      <li><a href="<https://www.pomerium.com/blog/>">Blog</a></li>
      <li><a href="<https://www.pomerium.com/docs>">Documentation</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="color:blueviolet">Happy coding!</h2>
  </body>
</html>
```

1. Go to **Extensions** and install [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
2. Right-click `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server**
3. Select any of the links to learn more about Pomerium

Great job! You successfully deployed code-server.

:::note

When the code-server container is rebuilt, any files outside of `/home/coder/project` are reset, removing any dependencies (such as go and make). In a real remote development workflow, you could mount additional volumes, or [use a custom code-server container](https://github.com/cdr/deploy-code-server/tree/main/deploy-container) with these dependencies installed.
