## Set up mTLS with Pomerium

This guide covers how to generate and set up TLS certificates suitable for working with Pomerium.

Tools and resources:

- [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/about/): a public CA that issues free certificates trusted by major browsers; other [private](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-build-your-own-public-key-infrastructure/) or [public](https://scotthelme.co.uk/are-ev-certificates-worth-the-paper-theyre-written-on/) CAs are also fine
- [mkcert](https://mkcert.org/): a free tool for generating self-signed certificates ideal for testing purposes
- [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/): a domain name registrar you will use to set up your wildcard domain and certificate validation. You can use other registrars as well (some even support [automatic renewal](https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi))
- [Acme.sh](https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh): an Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) client you will use to fetch your wildcard certificate. Any [LetsEncrypt client](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/) that supports wildcard domains would work.

:::note

There are countless ways to build and manage your public-key infrastructure. Although we hope this guide serves as a helpful baseline for generating and securing Pomerium with certificates, you should modify these instructions to meet your own organization's tools, needs, and constraints.

In a production environment you will likely use your corporate load balancer or a key management system to manage your certificate authority infrastructure.

:::

### Set up DNS

Set a CNAME record for the wildcard domain you will use with Pomerium.

### Enable per-route TLS certificate automation

Pomerium can retrieve, manage, and renew certificates for you (for free) using LetsEncrypt. To enable certificate automation, you must allow public traffic on ports `80` and `443`.

To use Pomerium’s autocert configuration setting, set `autocert` to `true` in your configuration file:

```yaml
autocert: true
```

See the [Autocert] and [Autocert Directory] settings for more information.

### Generate a self-signed wildcard certificate

In production, you would use a public CA like LetsEncrypt to generate your wildcard certificate. For a local proof of concept or development, you can use mkcert to generate a locally-trusted, self-signed development certificate with any name you like.

For the purposes of this guide, create a wildcard certificate using the domain `*.localhost.pomerium.io`, which we’ve pre-configured to route to localhost.

1.  Install mkcert.

    <Tabs>

    <TabItem value="go" label="Go">

    ```bash
    go install filippo.io/mkcert@latest
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="homebrew" label="Homebrew">

    ```bash
    brew install mkcert
    ```

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

1.  Bootstrap mkcert's root certificate into your operating system's trust store.

    ```bash
    mkcert -install
    ```

1.  Create your wildcard domain. `*.localhost.pomerium.io` is a helper domain we've hard-coded to route to localhost:

    ```bash
    mkcert "*.localhost.pomerium.io"
    ```

### Sign wildcard certificate

With your wildcard domain set at `*.localhost.pomerium.io`, use acme.sh to create a certificate signing request with LetsEncrypt.

<GenerateWildcardCert />

LetsEncrypt will respond with the corresponding `TXT` record needed to verify your domain.

![pomerium add a text entry to your dns records](./img/certificates/certificate-domain-challenge.png)

It may take a few minutes for the DNS records to propagate. Once they do, run the following command to complete the certificate request process:

```bash
acme.sh  --signcsr  --csr /path/to/mycsr/csr  --dns  dns_cf
```

Here's how the above certificates signed by LetsEncrypt correspond to their respective Pomerium configuration settings:

| Pomerium Config | Certificate file |
| --- | --- |
| [CERTIFICATE] | `$HOME/.acme.sh/*.corp.example.com_ecc/fullchain.cer` |
| [CERTIFICATE_KEY][certificate] | `$HOME/.acme.sh/*.corp.example.com_ecc/*.corp.example.com.key` |

Your end users will see a valid certificate for all domains delegated by Pomerium.

:::caution

LetsEncrypt certificates must be renewed [every 90 days](https://letsencrypt.org/2015/11/09/why-90-days.html).

## Resources

Certificates, TLS, and Public Key Cryptography is a vast subject we cannot adequately cover here. If you are unfamiliar with these topics, the following resources may be helpful:

- [Why HTTPS for Everything?](https://https.cio.gov/everything/) The US government's CIO office has an excellent guide covering HTTPS and why future government sites will all be HTTPS.
- [Is TLS Fast](https://istlsfastyet.com/) debunks the performance myth associated with HTTPS.
- [Use TLS](https://smallstep.com/blog/use-tls.html) covers why TLS should be used everywhere; not just for securing typical internet traffic, but for securing service communication in both "trusted" and adversarial situations.
