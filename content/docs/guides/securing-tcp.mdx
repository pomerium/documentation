# Securing TCP-based services

Learn how to use Pomerium's [TCP Proxying](/docs/capabilities/tcp) support to connect to TCP services, such as databases and non-HTTP protocols.

## Background

When replacing a traditional VPN, there are often non-HTTP based applications you still need to reach. Pomerium can provide the same type of protection to these services with [Pomerium CLI](/docs/deploy/clients/pomerium-cli), a client-side application to proxy TCP connections.

Authentication and authorization configuration is shared with standard HTTP routes, and the underlying transport is still encrypted between the end-user and Pomerium.

:::note

- Pomerium authorizes TCP connections on a **per-connection basis** (unlike HTTP requests, which it authorizes on a per-request basis)
- Pomerium only authorizes the TCP _connection_; it does not interact with application level authorization systems

:::

## Overview

Review the steps below to understand how you will secure TCP connections with Pomerium:

1. Run Pomerium CLI's `tcp` command in your workstation to listen for TCP connections on loopback
1. When an inbound connection is made, Pomerium CLI proxies the connection through `pomerium`, authenticating the user if needed
1. Pomerium authorizes the connection and forwards it to the upstream service

## Before you start

To complete this guide, you need:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Pomerium CLI](/docs/deploy/clients/pomerium-cli)
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) (optional)

## Certificates (optional)

If you want to generate your own locally trusted certificates with `mkcert`, run the following command:

```bash
mkcert -install
   mkcert '*.localhost.pomerium.io'
```

This will install a trusted CA and generate a new wildcard certificate:

- `_wildcard.localhost.pomerium.io.pem`
- `_wildcard.localhost.pomerium.io-key.pem`

## Configure

### Pomerium

Add the configuration below to your configuration file:

<PomeriumConfig />

:::note

Make sure you update each `example.com` instance to match the domain of your email address.

:::

### Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file to run Pomerium and the services you will connect to over TCP.

The following services are included in the Docker Compose file:

- **Redis**
- **SSH**
- **Postgres**

<DockerCompose />

## Connect

To connect to your service, ensure `pomerium-cli` is in your `$PATH` and run the `tcp` command, specifying the service you wish to reach.

```bash
pomerium-cli tcp [hostname]:[port]
```

`pomerium-cli` will select a random port on `localhost` by default, but you can specify a port manually if desired. Keep reading for some specific application examples using the sample `docker-compose.yaml`.

:::caution

If you haven't configured a trusted certificate, you'll need to add the `--disable-tls-verification` flag to the `pomerium-cli` commands below.

Without this flag, TCP connections will fail unless you include a trusted CA and certificate in your configuration.

In a production environment, it's critical that you configure Pomerium to use correct server certificates.

- See [**Certificates settings**](/docs/reference/certificates) and [**Upstream mTLS (services)**](/docs/capabilities/mtls-services) for more information on configuring certificates in Pomerium

- See the [**TCP Reference**](/docs/capabilities/tcp/reference) page for a complete list of commands available in Pomerium CLI

## Redis

Start a proxy to Redis in the background:

```shell-session
$ pomerium-cli tcp redis.localhost.pomerium.io:6379 --listen localhost:6379
2023/10/02 12:20:05 listening on 127.0.0.1:6379
```

Start the Redis client:

```shell-session
$ redis-cli info
# Server
redis_version:7.0.5
redis_git_sha1:00000000
redis_git_dirty:0
redis_build_id:d9291579292e26e3
redis_mode:standalone

uptime_in_days:0
hz:10
configured_hz:10
lru_clock:1851149
executable:/data/redis-server
config_file:
io_threads_active:0
```

## Postgres

In your Docker Compose file, `postgres` is the configured password for the `postgres` user and database.

Start a proxy to Postgres in the background:

```shell-session
$ pomerium-cli tcp pgsql.localhost.pomerium.io:5432 --listen localhost:5432
2023/10/03 12:22:08 listening on 127.0.0.1:5432
```

After password authentication, connect and list the schemas:

```shell-session
$  psql -h localhost -W -U postgres -c '\dn'
Password:
       List of schemas
   Name   |       Owner
----------+-------------------
 pomerium | postgres
 public   | pg_database_owner
(2 rows)
```

## SSH

### Configure

To configure your SSH client to use Pomerium's TCP support for SSH routes, create the following entry in your `ssh_config` or `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host *.localhost.pomerium.io
    ProxyCommand pomerium-cli tcp --listen - %h:%p
```

- Be sure to substitute your domain for `localhost.pomerium.io`
- Be sure `pomerium-cli` is in your `$PATH`

:::info

SSH clients can use external programs to establish a connection to a host. Most frequently, this is for using an SSH jump host to reach a target system. However, you can use any transport application. You can use Pomerium CLI's `tcp` command in conjunction with this configuration.

See the following links for more information:

- [OpenBSD Proxy Command](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5#ProxyCommand)
- [ProxyJump with RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/ssh-proxy-bastion-proxyjump)

:::

### Connect

Start a proxy to the SSH client in the background:

```shell-session
$ pomerium-cli tcp ssh.localhost.pomerium.io:22 --listen :2222
2023/10/03 12:29:17 listening on 127.0.0.1:50741
```

Initiate the SSH connection:

```shell-session
$ ssh myuser@ssh.localhost.pomerium.io -p 2222
myuser@ssh.localhost.pomerium.io's password:
Welcome to OpenSSH Server

4e737e02c43f:~$
```

In your example Docker Compose file, you have an SSH server configured with `supersecret` as the password for `myuser`.

That's it! A Pomerium proxy will be started _automatically_ whenever you SSH to a host under `localhost.pomerium.io`.
