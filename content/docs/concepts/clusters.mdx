# Clusters in Pomerium Zero

This document describes Clusters in Pomerium Zero.

TODO: include a video that walks through Clusters

## Clusters overview

A **Cluster** represents a single Pomerium deployment managed by Pomerium Zero, our hosted control plane. Pomerium Zero enables you to configure cluster settings for your personal account or organization.

Each cluster gets its own:

- **Cluster identity**
- **Cluster domain**
- **Cluster settings**
- **Routes and Policies**
- **Wildcard certificates**

### Cluster architecture

TODO: It would be ideal to get an architecture diagram here.

### Cluster identity

When you create an account in Pomerium Zero, a new cluster with its own **Cluster Identity** is generated and assigned to your personal account. Pomerium Zero tethers this cluster to your account with the **Pomerium Zero Token** value provided to you during onboarding.

This cluster identity token acts as a refresh token that you can use to generate a new cluster identity token in the Zero Console (see the [**Rotate cluster identity**](#rotate-cluster-identity) steps below).

#### Rotate cluster identity

A cluster identity token does not have a set expiration time. However, you may want to rotate the cluster identity in the Zero Console for security reasons. After you rotate the cluster identity, the previous token becomes obsolete.

  <summary>How to rotate cluster identity in the Zero Console</summary>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>From the navigation bar dropdown, select **Manage Clusters**</li>
      <li>Under **Actions**, select the **edit** icon</li>
      <li>Select the **Domains** tab</li>
      <li>In the **Cluster Identity** field, select **Rotate Identity**</li>
      <li>Copy the token and replace the old one in your configuration file</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</details>

### Cluster domain

Pomerium Zero generates and assigns a unique **Cluster Domain** to your cluster. Your cluster domain contains your randomly generated **Cluster Name** and the `pomerium.app` subdomain.

It follows this format: `<CLUSTER-NAME-XXXX>.pomerium.app`

For example: `voracious-ape-1578.pomerium.app`

#### Change cluster Name

If you don't like your randomly generated cluster name, you can change it manually in your cluster settings.

<details>
  <summary>How to change the cluster name in the Zero Console</summary>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>From the navigation bar dropdown, select **Manage Clusters**</li>
      <li>Under **Actions**, select the **edit** icon</li>
      <li>In the **Cluster Name** field, enter your preferred cluster name</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</details>

### Cluster settings

Each cluster is assigned its own **Cluster settings** object, meaning the available settings within a cluster apply only to that cluster instance and are not shared with another cluster instance generated with the same cluster identity token.

### Routes and Policies

**Routes** and **Policies** defined in a cluster are scoped only to that cluster, and are not available in another cluster instance.

To learn more about routing and policies in Pomerium, see the following docs:

- [**Routing**](/docs/capabilities/routing)
- [**Policy Language**](/docs/capabilities/policy-language)

### Wildcard certificates

Pomerium Zero issues **Wildcard Certificates** generated by ZeroSSL for each cluster. You can view the **Cert Details** of a certificate in the **Certificates** settings dashboard: ![The Cluster Cert window in the Zero Console](./img/certificates/cluster-cert-details.png)

See [**Certificates**](/docs/concepts/certificates) to learn more about how certificates work in Pomerium.
