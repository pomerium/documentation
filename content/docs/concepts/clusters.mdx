# Clusters in Pomerium Zero

This document discusses Clusters in Pomerium Zero.

## Clusters overview

A **Cluster** represents a single Pomerium deployment managed by Pomerium Zero, our hosted control plane. Pomerium Zero enables you to configure cluster settings for your personal account or organization.

Each cluster includes its own:

- Cluster identity
- Cluster domain
- Settings object
- Routes
- Policies
- Wildcard certificates

### Cluster architecture

### Cluster identity

When you install Pomerium Zero, a new cluster with its own **Cluster Identity** is generated and assigned to your personal account. A cluster's identity is distinct from user, service account, or API user identities.

#### Rotate cluster identity

Pomerium Zero tethers a cluster to your account with a **Pomerium Zero Token**. This token is generated when you create an account, and acts as a refresh token that you can use to generate a new identity token in the Zero Console.

Although the Pomerium Zero token does not expire, you may want to rotate the cluster identity in the Zero Console as needed. After you rotate the cluster identity, the previous token becomes obsolete.
