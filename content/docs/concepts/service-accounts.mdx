# Service Accounts

Service accounts provides bearer token based authentication for machine-to-machine communication through Pomerium to your protected endpoints. They can provide auth for monitoring services, create API integrations, and other non-human driven scripts or services.

A service account identity can either be based on a user entry in your IdP Directory, or exist as a custom identity managed in a Pomerium Console [Namespace](/docs/capabilities/namespacing).

See the [Service Accounts](/docs/capabilities/service-accounts) capabilities page for more information on how to use service accounts in Pomerium.
