# Routes

Routes define the connection pathway and configuration from the internet to your internal service. As a very basic level, a route sends traffic from `external-address.company.com` to `internalService-address.localdomain`, restricted by the policies associated with it, and encrypted by your TLS certificates. But more advanced configurations allow identity header pass-through, path and prefix rewrites, request and response header modification, load balancer services, and other full featured ingress capabilities.

For more information, see [Reference: Routes](#reference-routes)

## Protected Endpoints

This term refers to the system or service the route provides or restricts access to.

## Moving Routes

When moving a Route from one [Namespace](#namespace) to another, enforced policies will automatically be removed or applied. Optional policies available in the source Namespace but not the target will prevent the move. This is intentional to prevent unassociated policies.
