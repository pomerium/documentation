Pomerium will use the [**Hosted Authenticate Service**](/docs/capabilities/hosted-authenticate-service) by default in configurations that don't specify an authenticate service URL.

See the [**Self-Hosted Authenticate Service**](/docs/capabilities/self-hosted-authenticate-service) page if you prefer to use your own authenticate service.
