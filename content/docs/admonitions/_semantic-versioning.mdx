### Versioning

Pomerium uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). In practice, this means for a given version number **vMAJOR**.**MINOR**.**PATCH** (for example, `v0.1.0`):

- **MAJOR** indicates an incompatible API change
- **MINOR** indicates a new, backwards-compatible functionality
- **PATCH** indicates a backwards-compatible bug fix

As Pomerium is still pre-`v1.0.0`, you should expect breaking changes between releases.
