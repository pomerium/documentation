When you create a [TCP](/docs/capabilities/tcp) or [Websocket](/docs/reference/routes/timeouts#websocket-connections) connection, Pomerium validates the access policy at the time the connection is made.

Currently, there is no mechanism in place to terminate long-running connections if a policy becomes invalid.
