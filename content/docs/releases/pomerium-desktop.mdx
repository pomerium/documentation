# Pomerium Desktop (GUI)

Pomerium desktop (optional, optional, Pomerium is clientless for HTTP based protocols) does everything `pomerium-cli` does, but is geared towards users who prefer a graphical user interface. Functions include acting as an authentication helper for tools like [kubectl](/docs/deploying/k8s/configure.md) or TCP [based applications](/docs/capabilities/tcp/).

- Supported Operating Systems: `linux`, `darwin`, `windows`,
- Supported Architectures: `amd64`, `arm64`, `armv6`, `armv7`
