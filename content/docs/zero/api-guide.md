# Get Started With the Pomerium Zero API

This guide walks you through creating your first route and policy with the Pomerium Zero API.

:::tip

Throughout this guide, you can refer to either the [**Zero API reference**](/docs/api) or the Zero API playground at `https://console.pomerium.app/openapi`.

:::

## 1. Authenticate

### Get API User Token

The Zero API requires authenticated access for both personal accounts and organizations. To send an authenticated request, first create an **API User** in the Zero Console: 

1. In the **Account** menu, select **API Tokens**
1. Select **Add API User**
1. Name the API user and select **Create**
1. Copy the **API User Token** (keep it somewhere safe; you can't view it again)

### Get ID token

Now, exchange the API User Token for an ID token by sending a `POST` request to the `/token` endpoint. Make sure you replace `<API-USER-TOKEN>` with the one generated for you in the Zero Console:

```curl
curl --location 'https://console.pomerium.app/api/v0/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "refreshToken": "<API-USER-TOKEN>"
}'
```

If your request was successful, you'll get a response with a temporary ID token:

```json
{
    "expiresInSeconds": "3600",
    "idToken": "<ID-TOKEN>"
}
```

Copy the ID token and keep it somewhere safe. You won't be able to see it again, and you need it to make authenticated requests. 

## 2. Create a policy

To create a policy, you need your organization ID and your namespace ID.  

### Get organization ID

There are two types of organizations: **personal** and **professional**. When you create an account, you get a personal organization by default. 

To get your personal organization ID, send a `GET` request to the `/organizations` endpoint:

```curl
curl --location 'https://console.pomerium.app/api/v0/organizations' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ID-TOKEN>' \
--data ''
```

If your request was successful, you'll get a response with your organization ID and other related metadata:

```json
[
    {
        "createdAt": "2024-01-17T20:07:47.794672Z",
        "id": "bwjkRZwxbNXBQHHcJHphGSNBbxt",
        "joinedAt": "2024-05-29T20:27:27.336939Z",
        "name": "personal",
        "organizationType": "personal",
        "ownerUserId": "bMWxgvnRQfcRHjQvfMehbJhYFzB",
        "role": "admin",
        "updatedAt": "2024-01-17T20:07:47.794672Z"
    }
]
```

Copy your organization ID.

### Get namespace ID

In Pomerium Zero, each cluster is assigned its own namespace. To make changes to your cluster's configuration, you need your cluster's namespace ID. 

To get your cluster's namespace ID, send a `GET` request to the `/namespaces` endpoint, replacing `{organizationId}` with your own:

```curl
curl --location 'https://console.pomerium.app/api/v0/organizations/{organizationId}/namespaces' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ID-TOKEN>'
```

You'll get a response similar to the example below. In the JSON payload, the first object contains data about the organization, which functions as a root namespace with admin-level permissions.

The second object represents a cluster, which is assigned its own namespace. If you look at the `"parentId"` field, you'll notice that the cluster namespace is a child of the root namespace.

The `"cluster"` namespace ID is the one you need to make changes to your cluster through the API:

```json
[
    {
        "createdAt": "2024-01-17T20:07:47.794672Z",
        "id": "bwjkRZwxbNXBQHHcJHphGSNBbxt",
        "name": "personal",
        "role": "admin",
        "type": "root",
        "updatedAt": "2024-01-17T20:07:47.794672Z"
    },
    {
        "createdAt": "2024-01-17T20:07:49.173932Z",
        "id": "bjQWGxKgPJRSZWSBWpgRWMpJbsv",
        "name": "trusted-dog-1049",
        "parentId": "bwjkRZwxbNXBQHHcJHphGSNBbxt",
        "role": "admin",
        "type": "cluster",
        "updatedAt": "2024-05-29T15:07:07.938956Z"
    }
]
```

Go ahead and copy the `"cluster"` namespace ID.

### Build a policy

Now, you'll build a policy that only grants access if the user's email address matches exactly the email address specified in the policy.

To create a policy, send a `POST` request to the `/policies` endpoint:

```curl
curl --location 'https://console.pomerium.app/api/v0/organizations/{organizationId}/policies' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: <ID-TOKEN>' \
--data-raw '{
  "namespaceId": "bwjkRZwxbNXBQHHcJHphGSNBbxt",
  "name": "Allow only matching email",
  "enforced": false,
  "ppl": {
    "allow": {
      "and": [
        {"email": 
            {
            "is": "user@example.com"
            }
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "description": "Only allow users access with a matching email address.",
  "explanation": "You don'\''t have the correct email address to access this service.",
  "remediation": "Email address must match user@example.com"
}'
```
:::info

In the request example above, setting the `"enforced"` field to `false` means that the policy won't be automatically assigned to routes in your cluster. Setting this field to `true` has the opposite effect: it will assign this policy to your existing routes and any new routes added to your cluster.  

:::

If your request was successful, you should receive a response similar to the one below. Notice that the `"routes"` field is empty because this policy hasn't been assigned yet:

```json
{
    "createdAt": "2024-05-30T17:04:33.460441Z",
    "description": "Only allow users with a matching email address.",
    "enforced": false,
    "enforcedRoutes": [],
    "explanation": "You don't have the correct email address to access this service.",
    "id": "bgrXNgrJFJmMZvPsVsbZHGWxVWP",
    "name": "Allow matching email",
    "namespaceId": "bwjkRZwxbNXBQHHcJHphGSNBbxt",
    "ppl": {
        "allow": {
            "and": [
                {
                    "email": {
                        "is": "user@example.com"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    "remediation": "Email address must match user@example.com",
    "routes": [],
    "updatedAt": "2024-05-30T17:04:33.460441Z"
}
```

## 3. Create a route

Next, you'll create a route and attach it to the policy you just created. In this example, we're using [HTTPBin](https://httpbin.org/) as an example service, but you can use any service you want.

To create a route, you need to send a `POST` request to the `/routes` endpoint with your organization ID, namespace ID, and the policy ID of the policy you just created. Make sure you replace `{CLUSTER_STARTER_DOMAIN}` in the `"from"` field with your own:

```curl
curl --location 'https://console.pomerium.app/api/v0/organizations/{organizationId}/routes' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {ID-TOKEN}' \
--data '{
    "namespaceId": "bwjkRZwxbNXBQHHcJHphGSNBbxt",
    "name": "HTTP Bin",
    "from": "https://httpbin.{CLUSTER_STARTER_DOMAIN}.pomerium.app",
    "to": ["http://httpbin:80"],
    "allowWebsockets": false,
    "allowSpdy": false,
    "tlsSkipVerify": false,
    "tlsUpstreamAllowRenegotiation": false,
    "preserveHostHeader": false,
    "enableGoogleCloudServerlessAuthentication": false,
    "showErrorDetails": false,
    "policyIds": ["bgrXNgrJFJmMZvPsVsbZHGWxVWP"]
}'
```

You'll receive a response like the one below:

```json
{
    "allowSpdy": false,
    "allowWebsockets": false,
    "createdAt": "2024-05-30T20:21:05.087872Z",
    "enableGoogleCloudServerlessAuthentication": false,
    "enforcedPolicies": [],
    "enforcedPolicyIds": [],
    "from": "https://httpbin.trusted-dog-1049.pomerium.app",
    "id": "bFjRpQrVGFcBMWzKjvnRpmwwRXh",
    "name": "HTTP Bin",
    "namespaceId": "bwjkRZwxbNXBQHHcJHphGSNBbxt",
    "policies": [
        {
            "id": "bgrXNgrJFJmMZvPsVsbZHGWxVWP",
            "name": "Allow matching email"
        }
    ],
    "policyIds": [
        "bgrXNgrJFJmMZvPsVsbZHGWxVWP"
    ],
    "preserveHostHeader": false,
    "showErrorDetails": false,
    "tlsSkipVerify": false,
    "tlsUpstreamAllowRenegotiation": false,
    "to": [
        "http://httpbin:80"
    ],
    "updatedAt": "2024-05-30T20:21:05.087872Z"
}
```
