# Single Sign-on with JWTs

This guide shows you how to set up **Single Sign-on** (SSO) in Pomerium.

You'll configure:

- Pomerium to forward JWTs for identity verification
- The upstream Grafana service to accept JWTs for authentication

:::note ** Before you start

Make sure you've completed the following guides:

- [**Quickstart**](/docs/quickstart)
- [**Build Routes**](/docs/courses/zero-fundamentals/build-routes)

Each guide builds on the same configuration files.
