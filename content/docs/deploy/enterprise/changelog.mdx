# Changelog

## 0.25.0

### Breaking

- In this release, we removed support for the `debug` option in the Enterprise Console.

### Fixes

- Various UI improvements and an update to the route import feature to support the following PPL criteria when importing routes into Enterprise:
  - `allow_public_unauthenticated_access`
  - `allow_any_authenticated_user`
  - `allowed_idp_claims`

### Changed

- Adds an optional, global-level [Pass Identity Headers](/docs/reference/pass-identity-headers) setting, which sends identity headers to all upstream applications when enabled. If you want to forward identity headers only to a specific upstream application, you can still use the [per-route Pass Identity Headers](/docs/reference/routes/pass-identity-headers-per-route) setting.
- Removes support for the [Secure Cookie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_cookie) setting. It is always enabled by default.
- Improved error messages and multiple Open Telemetry improvements

## 0.24.0

### Breaking

- Removes support for the deprecated `set_authorization_header` setting. You can use the [Set Request Headers](/docs/reference/routes/headers#set-request-headers) setting to pass IdP tokens to upstream services in any header.

### Security

- Previously, the Enterprise Console logged gRPC calls and their payload data. This release removes payload data from the logs.

### New

- Now, you can configure device authentication using client certificates in the Enterprise Console's PPL builder.
- Performance improvements with configuration and service account syncs.

### Fixed

- Various UI improvements, and a fix that prevents missing policy criteria when migrating routes.

### Changed

- Various Telemetry fixes in the Console.

## 0.23.0

### New

- [Set Request Headers](/docs/reference/routes/headers#set-request-headers) has three new new token substitution values that it can send to upstream apps or services:
  - **Client certificate fingerprint** (the short-form SHA-256 fingerprint of the presented client certificate)
  - **ID token** (the OIDC ID token from the identity provider)
  - **Access token** (the OAuth access token from the identity provider)
- [Access Log Fields](/docs/reference/access-log-fields) and [Authorize Log Fields](/docs/reference/authorize-log-fields) settings allow you to customize the values that are logged in the access and authorize logs.
- [Cookies SameSite](/docs/reference/cookies#cookie-samesite) is now configurable in the Enterprise Console.

### Breaking

- When using `set_request_headers`, to prevent a ‘$’ character from being treated as the start of a variable substitution, you may need to replace it with ‘$$’.

## 0.22.0

### Security patch

- Pomerium upgraded to [Go v1.20.3](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Xdv6JL9ENs8/m/OV40vnafAwAJ) and [Envoy v1.24.5](https://groups.google.com/g/envoy-announce/c/o_W9gYVU2js/m/kU77ha6tBAAJ) to address security issues exposed in these packages. See the release notes in the links for more information.

### New

- [Hosted Authenticate Service](/docs/capabilities/hosted-authenticate-service.md) will now be used by default to handle single-sign-on. Pomerium hosts this service as a convenience to its users; no identity provider configuration or authenticate service url needs to be specified if the hosted authenticate service is used. [Self-hosted authenticate service](/docs/capabilities/self-hosted-authenticate-service.md) is still available for users who want to configure their own identity provider and authenticate service URL.
- [Wildcard From Routes](/docs/reference/routes/from#wildcard-from-routes) is a Beta support feature that allows you to define a wildcard route that points matching external routes to a single destination.
- [RDS changes](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/4098) provide more consistent and linear memory performance that significantly reduces memory consumption, especially in environments with rapidly changing configurations.
