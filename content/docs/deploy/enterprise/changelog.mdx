# Changelog

## 0.22.0

### Security patch

- Pomerium upgraded to [Go v1.20.3](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Xdv6JL9ENs8/m/OV40vnafAwAJ) and [Envoy v1.24.5](https://groups.google.com/g/envoy-announce/c/o_W9gYVU2js/m/kU77ha6tBAAJ) to address security issues exposed in these packages. See the release notes in the links for more information.

### New

- [Hosted Authenticate Service](/docs/capabilities/hosted-authenticate-service.md) will now be used by default to handle single-sign-on. Pomerium hosts this service as a convenience to its users; no identity provider configuration or authenticate service url needs to be specified if the hosted authenticate service is used. [Self-hosted authenticate service](/docs/capabilities/self-hosted-authenticate-service.md) is still available for users who want to configure their own identity provider and authenticate service URL.
- [Wildcard From Routes](/docs/reference/routes/from#wildcard-from-routes) is a Beta support feature that allows you to define a wildcard route that points matching external routes to a single destination.
- [RDS changes](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/4098) provide more consistent and linear memory performance that significantly reduces memory consumption, especially in environments with rapidly changing configurations.
