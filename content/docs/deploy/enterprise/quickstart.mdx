# Run Pomerium Enterprise With Docker

Run Pomerium Enterprise with Docker containers and connect to the Console.

This guide uses our [**Hosted Authenticate Service**](/docs/capabilities/hosted-authenticate-service). If you use our hosted service and have a license key, you can complete this guide in **under 5 minutes**.

See the [Self-Hosted Authenticate Service](/docs/capabilities/self-hosted-authenticate-service) page if you want to self-host Pomerium.

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

- [Pomerium Core](/docs/quickstart)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

This guide assumes you've already registered for Pomerium Enterprise and have credentials to access the private **Cloudsmith.io Docker registry**, and a **license key**. If you haven't registered for Pomerium Enterprise, [sign up here](https://www.pomerium.com/enterprise-sales/) for a free trial.

  <summary>Install Pomerium Enterprise with Docker</summary>
    <div>
1. In your terminal, run the following command:

```shell
docker login docker.cloudsmith.io
```

2. Enter your <b>username</b> and <b>password</b>:

```shell
% docker login docker.cloudsmith.io
Username: <username>
Password: <password>
```

3. Pull a specific tagged release of the Pomerium Enterprise image:

```shell
docker pull docker.cloudsmith.io/pomerium/enterprise/pomerium-console:${vX.X.X}
```

   </div>
</details>

## Configure Pomerium Core

If you haven't, create a file called `config.yaml` and add the following code:

<HostedConfig />

Replace `user@example.com` with your email address.

## Configure Pomerium Enterprise Console

:::note

This guide assumes you've already registered for Pomerium Enterprise and have credentials to access the private Cloudsmith.io Docker registry, and a license key. If you haven't registered for Pomerium Enterprise, [sign up here](https://www.pomerium.com/enterprise-sales/) for a free trial.

To access the Pomerium Enterprise Docker image:

1. In your terminal, run the following command:

```shell
docker login docker.cloudsmith.io
```

2. Enter your **username** and **password**:

```shell
 % docker login docker.cloudsmith.io
Username: <username>
Password: <password>
```

3. Pull a specific tagged release of the Pomerium Enterprise image:

```shell
docker pull docker.cloudsmith.io/pomerium/enterprise/pomerium-console:${vX.X.X}
```

:::

Create a file called `console-config.yaml` and update the following values:

```title="console-config.yaml"
administrators: admin@example.com
license_key: REPLACE_ME
```

You must configure at least one administrator for console access. This user (or users) can then configure additional administrators in the console UI.

Multiple administrators are defined as a comma-separated string.

## Configure Docker Compose services

Create a file called `docker-compose.yaml` in your project's root folder and add the configuration below:

<HostedCompose />

Below are a few points to note about services running in `docker-compose.yaml`:

- `pomerium_console` exposes ports `8701` and `9090`. In your `config.yaml` file, you define port `8701` in a route that connects to the Pomerium Enterprise Console. Port `9090` is the [default port](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#configuring-prometheus) used by Prometheus to scrape metrics.
- The healthcheck parameter ensures the database is ready to receive requests. Without a healthcheck, other containers that depend on the database service (like Pomerium Console) will attempt to connect to the database before it is in a ready state, **which will crash the container**. (See the [Docker healthcheck](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck) docs for more information.)

## Connect to Pomerium Enterprise Console

Run `docker compose up`.

Go to `https://console.localhost.pomerium.io` to access your Console.

## Next Steps

If you want to try connecting Pomerium with other services, see some of our [Guides](/docs/guides).
