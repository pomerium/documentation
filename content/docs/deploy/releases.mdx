# Pomerium Releases

Learn how Pomerium schedules and versions its releases.

## Pomerium Products

Pomerium's suite of products includes:

- [Pomerium Core](/docs/deploy/core): An open-source reverse proxy that all the other Pomerium components are built on top of
- [Pomerium Enterprise](/docs/deploy/enterprise): The Enterprise Console built on top of Pomerium Core
- [Pomerium Ingress Controller for Kubernetes](/docs/deploy/k8s/ingress): Pomerium's Ingress Controller, designed to run Pomerium Core and Enterprise in Kubernetes environments
- [Pomerium CLI](/docs/deploy/clients/pomerium-cli): A CLI client that helps you authenticate and manage tools like Kubectl and TCP-based connections in Pomerium
- [Pomerium Desktop](/docs/deploy/clients/pomerium-desktop): A desktop client that works just like Pomerium CLI, but with a user-friendly UI to manage connections

All of Pomerium's products follow the same release cycle. See the sections below for more information.

## Release timing

The current release cycle is aligned on a monthly basis. Pre-`1.0.0` we target a `MINOR` release on or around the **first day of each month**. We try to hit the targets as closely as possible, while still delivering a quality release.

## Versioning

Pomerium uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). In practice this means for a given version number **vMAJOR**.**MINOR**.**PATCH** (e.g. `v0.1.0`):

- **MAJOR** indicates an incompatible API change,
- **MINOR** indicates a new functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
- **PATCH** indicates a backwards-compatible bug fix.

As Pomerium is still pre-`v1.0.0`, breaking changes between releases should be expected.

## Changelogs and Upgrading

To see the differences between releases, refer to the Core or Enterprise changelogs and upgrading pages below (changes to Pomerium CLI, Desktop, and Ingress Controller are also included here).
