## Upgrade Guide (Core Edition)

:::tip

Changelog notes for Pomerium Core can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/releases).

:::

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes for Pomerium Core. Please read it carefully before upgrading.

### 0.28.0

There are no breaking changes in v0.28.

### 0.27.0

#### Breaking

##### Deprecated JWT endpoint

The `/.pomerium/jwt` endpoint is now deprecated and disabled by default. You can temporarily opt out of this deprecation by setting the runtime flag [`pomerium_jwt_endpoint`](/docs/reference/runtime-flags) to `true`. This flag will be removed in a future release.

- **Context**: This endpoint was originally added for single-page web apps to get information about the currently signed-in user, but that same user data can be fetched without a signed JWT.
- **New approach**: A new `/.pomerium/user` endpoint provides user data as plaintext JSON. If you use Pomerium’s [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/pomerium/js-sdk), version 1.1.0 includes `getBrowserUser()`, which replaces `verifyBrowserUser()`.

##### Upgrading Pomerium Zero deployments in Kubernetes

For Pomerium Zero in Kubernetes, we updated the manifest to use a **Deployment** instead of a StatefulSet. Before upgrading, delete your old StatefulSet:

```bash
kubectl delete statefulset/pomerium -n pomerium-zero
```

Then apply the new deployment:

```bash
kubectl apply -k github.com/pomerium/pomerium/k8s/zero
```

### 0.26.0

##### Routes port matching

- **Previous Behavior**: Pomerium required the request’s `Host` header to match the route’s `from` URL exactly, including port.
- **New Behavior**: If your `from` URL does not include an explicit port, Pomerium ignores the incoming port. This helps with NAT or load balancers that change the request port.
- **Note**: You can revert to the old behavior by setting the runtime flag `match_any_incoming_port=false`.

##### Host header rewrite

Pomerium now rewrites the host header to match the `to` URL consistently, including port if specified. Use [Preserve Host Header](/docs/reference/routes/headers#1-preserve-host-header) if you need to keep the original host.

##### Session refresh reliability

- Pomerium’s approach to refreshing OAuth tokens changed to be more reliable, potentially increasing the rate of requests to your identity provider.
- You can restore the previous approach with runtime flag `legacy_identity_manager=true`.

##### Deprecations

- `client_ca` is removed. Use `downstream_mtls.ca` or `DOWNSTREAM_MTLS_CA` instead.

### 0.25.0

#### Breaking

##### Base64-encoded Certificates

The `certificates` key no longer supports base64-encoded cert data (this was undocumented). Provide a file location instead.

**Note**: The singular `certificate` key still supports base64-encoded cert data.

##### Remove Debug Option

Support for a `Debug` setting was removed. If you prefer pretty-print logs, pipe JSON logs into `jq`.

#### New

##### Authentication Flows

- For self-hosted deployments, the flow reverts to a v0.20–like approach.
- For Hosted Authenticate, it continues with the flow introduced in v0.21.

### 0.24.0

#### Breaking

##### Remove `set_authorization_header`

Use [Set Request Headers](/docs/reference/routes/headers#set-request-headers) with variable substitution to pass ID tokens upstream.

##### Base64-encoded `certificates` Key

Support was removed (the second mention). Provide a file path instead.

##### Redis Storage

Redis was deprecated as a data storage backend, replaced by PostgreSQL since v0.18. Redis is now removed.

### 0.23.0

#### Logging Configs

- [Access Log Fields](/docs/reference/access-log-fields) and [Authorize Log Fields](/docs/reference/authorize-log-fields) let you customize what fields are logged.

#### Downstream mTLS Settings

- Moved to a new `downstream_mtls` block.
- Support for CRLs, a new [Enforcement Mode](/docs/reference/downstream-mtls-settings#enforcement-mode), and optional [Match Subject Alt Names](/docs/reference/downstream-mtls-settings#match-sans).
- The [TLS Downstream Client Certificate Authority](/docs/reference/routes/tls#tls-downstream-client-certificate-authority) setting is deprecated.

##### Breaking

###### Set Request Headers `$` Substitution

To avoid `$` being interpreted as a variable start, you may need to escape `$` with `$$`.

### 0.22.0

#### New

- [Hosted Authenticate Service](/docs/capabilities/authentication) is the default for SSO (no identity config needed).
- [Wildcard From Routes](/docs/reference/routes/from#wildcard-from-routes) in Beta.
- Improved memory usage in dynamic config environments.

##### Breaking

- Devices must be re-enrolled (internal data model changes).
- Forward auth is removed (subpar security).
- Bastion Host for TCP routes is now supported in a new way.

### 0.21.0

#### Breaking

- Re-enroll devices (data model changed, not forward compatible).
- Forward auth was removed in v0.21.
- Bastion host support for TCP routes.
- Internal TLS by default if you run Pomerium Enterprise.

### 0.20.0

#### Breaking

- `allowed_groups` and `groups` PPL criteria are removed for open source. Use IdP claims instead.
- IdP directory sync has moved to [External Data Sources](/docs/capabilities/integrations/) in Pomerium Enterprise. For open source, group membership must come from ID tokens.

### 0.19.0 / 0.18.0

No changes required.

### 0.17.0

#### Per Route OIDC

- `idp_client_id` and `idp_client_secret` can now be specified per route.

- OIDC flow no longer sets default `access_type=offline` except for Google.
- Removed `signing_key_algorithm` option.
- Some GitHub group IDs changed from integer to slug with the new GraphQL approach.

### 0.15.0

- Removed unused options: `grpc_server_max_connection_age`, `grpc_server_max_connection_age_grace`, `refresh_cooldown`.
- Ed25519 signing keys are no longer supported.
- Expanded PPL route syntax in `routes`.

### 0.14.0

#### Breaking

- Programmatic login domain whitelist introduced: default `localhost`. Use `programmatic_redirect_domain_whitelist` to configure.
- GitHub team IDs now use slugs instead of numeric IDs.
- `allowed_users` by ID no longer includes the identity provider prefix.

#### Breaking

- User impersonation and client-side service accounts removed (server-side approach in Enterprise now).

### 0.12.0

- **TCP Proxying** introduced.

### 0.11.0

### 0.10.0

#### Breaking

- Service accounts are required for group/directory data.
- `cache` service becomes `databroker`, storing identity data.
- `pass_identity_headers` must be explicitly set true if you want identity headers.

### 0.9.0

#### Breaking

- Default log level is `info`.
- HTTP 1.0 not supported. For HAProxy health checks, set `HTTP/1.1\r\nHost:pomerium`.

### 0.8.0

#### Breaking

- `from` routes with a path are no longer valid (use `prefix` instead).

### 0.7.0
