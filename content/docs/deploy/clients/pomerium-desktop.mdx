# Pomerium Desktop

Pomerium Desktop does everything `pomerium-cli` does, but is designed for users who prefer a graphical user interface.

Functions include acting as an authentication helper for tools like [kubectl](/docs/deploy/k8s/configure.md) or TCP [based applications](/docs/capabilities/tcp/).

- Supported Operating Systems: `linux`, `darwin`, `windows`,
- Supported Architectures: `amd64`, `arm64`, `armv6`, `armv7`

## Packages

Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/pomerium/desktop-client/releases).

- **Windows**: The installer `.exe` file will install and open the Desktop Client. Right click on the system tray icon to interact with it.
- **Linux**: We provide Linux binaries as `.AppImage` files, which can be executed in place or managed with a tool like [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher). Interact with the client from the system tray icon.
- **macOS**: Open the `dmg` and move the binary to **Applications**. Interact with the client from the system tray icon.

## Brew (OSX)

Alternatively, on Mac.

```shell
brew tap pomerium/tap
brew install pomerium-desktop
```
