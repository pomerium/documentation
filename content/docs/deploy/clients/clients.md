# Pomerium Core Clients

Pomerium offers optional CLI and Desktop clients:

- [Pomerium CLI](/docs/capabilities/non-http/client)
- [Pomerium Desktop](/docs/capabilities/non-http/client)

Both the CLI and Desktop clients act as an authentication helper for tools like kubectl and TCP/UDP-based connections.

See the [Pomerium Desktop and CLI Clients](/docs/capabilities/non-http/client) page for more information.
