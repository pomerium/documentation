Pomerium Policy Language (**PPL**) is a [yaml]-based notation for creating easy and flexible authorization policies. This document covers the usage of PPL and provides several example policies.

PPL allows administrators to express authorization policy in a high-level, declarative language that promotes safe, performant, fine-grained controls.

:::note

See the [**Policy setting**](/docs/reference/routes/policy) page to learn how to apply a PPL policy to a route.

:::

## At a Glance

Each PPL policy has at the top level a set of `allow` or `deny` actions, with a list of logical operators, criteria, matchers, and values underneath. For example:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - domain:
        is: example.com
deny:
  or:
    - email:
        is: user2@example.com
    - email:
        is: user3@example.com
```

This policy grants access only if the domain portion of a user's email address matches the specified value, `example.com`.

It will deny access to users with a `user2@example.com` **or** `user3@example.com` email address.

## Rules

A PPL document is either an object or an array of objects. The object represents a rule where the action is the key and the value is an object containing the logical operators.

## Actions

Only two actions are supported: `allow` and `deny`. `deny` takes precedence over `allow`. More precisely: a user will have access to a route if **at least one** `allow` rule matches and **no** `deny` rules match.

## Logical Operators

A logical operator combines multiple criteria together for the evaluation of a rule. There are 4 logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not` and `nor`.

<details>
  <summary>More on Logical Operators</summary>
  <div>

Given the following example with `OPERATOR` replaced:

```yaml
allow:
  OPERATOR:
    - domain:
        is: example.com
    - claim/groups: admin
```

If `and` is used, the user will have access if their email address ends in `example.com` **and** they are a member of the admin group. **(A ∧ B)**

If `or` is used, the user will have access if their email address ends in `example.com` **or** they are a member of the admin group. **(A ∨ B)**

If `not` is used, the user will have access if their email address does not end in `example.com` **and** they are not a member of the `admin` group. **(¬A ∧ ¬B) = ¬(A ∨ B)** (This operation is traditionally called **NOR** in the Boolean algebra.)

If `nor` is used, the user will have access if their email address does not end in `example.com` **or** they are not a member of the admin group. **(¬A ∨ ¬B) = ¬(A ∧ B)** (This operation is traditionally called **NAND** in the Boolean algebra.)

  </div>
</details>

### Multiple Operators in a Rule

You _can_ add multiple operators under the same rule, and it would be valid PPL.

For example, this policy would grant access to anyone with a `family_name: Smith` claim, **or** users with email addresses ending in `domain1` or `domain2`:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - claim/family_name: Smith
  or:
    - domain:
        is: domain1.com
    - domain:
        is: domain2.com
```

However, you could write an equivalent policy with multiple `allow` blocks:

```yaml
- allow:
    and:
      - claim/family_name: Smith
- allow:
    or:
      - domain:
          is: domain1.com
      - domain:
          is: domain2.com
```

Although these policies are equally effective, we recommend using just one operator per rule.

## Criteria

Criteria in PPL are represented as an object where the key is the name and optional sub-path of the criterion, and the value changes depending on which criterion is used. A sub-path is indicated with a `/` in the name:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - claim/family_name: Smith
deny:
  not:
    - http_method:
        is: GET
```

### Supported PPL Criteria

Below is an exhaustive list of PPL criteria.

Entries marked with `*` denote criteria that are only available in the [Enterprise Console](/docs/deploy/enterprise) PPL builder. All other entries are available in both Pomerium Core and Pomerium Enterprise.

| Criterion Name | Data Format | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `accept` | Anything. Typically `true`. | Always returns true, thus always allowing access. Equivalent to the [`allow_public_unauthenticated_access`] option. |
| `authenticated_user` | Anything. Typically `true`. | Always returns true for logged-in users. Equivalent to the [`allow_any_authenticated_user`] option. |
| `claim` | Anything. Typically a string. | Returns true if a token claim matches the supplied value **exactly**. The claim to check is determined via the sub-path. <br/> For example, `claim/family_name: Smith` matches if the user's `family_name` claim is `Smith`. |
| `client_certificate` | [Certificate matcher] | Returns true if a client presented a TLS certificate matching the provided condition. |
| `cors_preflight` | Anything. Typically `true`. | Returns true if the incoming request uses the `OPTIONS` method and has both the `Access-Control-Request-Method` and `Origin` headers. Used to allow [CORS pre-flight requests]. |
| \* `date` | [Date Matcher] | Returns true if the time of the request matches the constraints. |
| \* `day_of_week` | [Day of Week Matcher] | Returns true if the day of the request matches the constraints. |
| `device` | [Device matcher] | Returns true if the incoming request includes a valid device ID or type. |
| `domain` | [String Matcher] | Returns true if the logged-in user's email address domain (the part after `@`) matches the given value. |
| `email` | [String Matcher] | Returns true if the logged-in user's email address matches the given value. |
| \* `groups` | [String List Matcher] | Returns true if a user's group ID matches the supplied value **exactly**. `groups` data is only available after a successful directory sync. See [Identity Providers](/docs/integrations/user-identity/identity-providers) for vendor-specific directory sync steps. |
| `http_method` | [String Matcher] | Returns true if the HTTP method matches the given value. |
| `http_path` | [String Matcher] | Returns true if the HTTP path matches the given value. |
| `mcp_tool` | [String Matcher] | Returns true if, for MCP routes, the tool name in a `tools/call` request matches the provided condition. Recommended to use under `deny` to block specific tools or classes of tools without affecting non-tool requests. See [MCP Support](/docs/capabilities/mcp#policy-based-tool-access-control). |
| `invalid_client_certificate` | Anything. Typically `true`. | Returns true if the incoming request does not have a trusted client certificate. By default, a `deny` rule using this criterion is added to all Pomerium policies when [downstream mTLS] is configured (but this default can be changed using the [Enforcement Mode](/docs/reference/downstream-mtls-settings#enforcement-mode) setting.) |
| `pomerium_routes` | Anything. Typically `true`. | Returns true if the incoming request is for the special `.pomerium` routes. A default `allow` rule using this criterion is added to all Pomerium policies. |
| \* `record` | variable | Allows policies to be extended using data from [external data sources](/docs/capabilities/integrations). See [Record Matcher](#record-matcher) for more information. |
| `reject` | Anything. Typically `true`. | Always returns false. The opposite of `accept`. |
| `source_ip` | String or list of strings, each containing an IP address or CIDR range. | Returns true if the incoming request was from an IP address matching any element of the list. |
| \* `time_of_day` | [Time of Day Matcher] | Returns true if the time of the request (for the current day) matches the constraints. |
| `user` | [String Matcher] | Returns `true` if the logged-in user's ID matches the supplied value. (The actual value of the user ID claim depends on how the identity provider sets this value.) |

Entries marked with `*` denote criteria that are only available in the [Enterprise Console](/docs/deploy/enterprise) PPL builder. All other entries are available in both Pomerium Core and Pomerium Enterprise.

:::note Protocol applicability: SSH

On SSH routes, the following PPL criteria do not apply: `http_method`, `http_path`, `cors_preflight`, `client_certificate`, `invalid_client_certificate`, `pomerium_routes`, `device`. For SSH-specific policy criteria, see [SSH Policy Criteria](/docs/capabilities/native-ssh-access#ssh-policy-criteria).

## Matchers

### Certificate Matcher

:::caution

The certificate matcher is a beta feature. The syntax and capabilities are subject to change in a future Pomerium release.

:::

A certificate matcher can be used to allow or deny certain TLS certificates. This matcher is represented as an object that may have the following key/value entries:

| Key Name | Value Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fingerprint` | string or array of strings | The certificate's SHA-256 fingerprint must match one of the provided values. |
| `san_dns` | [String Matcher] | The certificate must contain a Subject Alternative Name with a DNS name satisfying the provided condition. |
| `san_email` | [String Matcher] | The certificate must contain a Subject Alternative Name with an email address satisfying the provided condition. |
| `san_uri` | [String Matcher] | The certificate must contain a Subject Alternative Name with a URI satisfying the provided condition. |
| `spki_hash` | string or array of strings | The base64-encoded SHA-256 hash of the certificate's Subject Public Key Info must match one of the provided values. |

<details>
<summary>Notes on certificate fingerprint</summary>

The certificate fingerprint is a SHA-256 hash of the entire certificate. You can compute a certificate's fingerprint using the `openssl` command:

```shell-session
$ openssl x509 -in path/to/certificate.pem -noout -fingerprint -sha256
sha256 Fingerprint=17:85:92:73:E8:A9:80:63:1D:36:7B:2D:5A:6A:66:35:41:2B:0F:22:83:5F:69:E4:7B:3F:65:62:45:46:A7:04
```

This is the "long" form of a certificate fingerprint (32 uppercase hexadecimal bytes separated by colons). A "short" form is also acceptable (32 lowercase hexadecimal bytes, without colons). You can also compute this form using the `openssl` command:

```shell-session
$ openssl x509 -in path/to/certificate.pem -outform DER | openssl dgst -sha256
SHA2-256(stdin)= 17859273e8a980631d367b2d5a6a6635412b0f22835f69e47b3f65624546a704
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Notes on SPKI hash</summary>

The SPKI hash is a base64-encoded SHA-256 hash of the Subject Public Key Info section of the certificate. You can compute a certificate's SPKI hash using a sequence of `openssl` commands:

```shell-session
$ openssl x509 -in path/to/certificate.pem -noout -pubkey \
  | openssl pkey -pubin -outform DER \
  | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary \
  | openssl enc -base64
FsDbM0rUYIiL3V339eIKqiz6HPSB+Pz2WeAWhqlqh8U=
```

The advantage of using the SPKI hash rather than the certificate fingerprint is that the SPKI hash may be stable across certificate renewals (if the public/private key pair is the same).

</details>

For example, to allow only certificates containing a Subject Alternative Name with an email address ending in `@yourdomain.com` (while also requiring the user to sign in with the configured identity provider):

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - authenticated_user: true
    - client_certificate:
        san_email:
          ends_with: '@yourdomain.com'
```

Or, to allow only one specific trusted certificate (again, while still requiring the user to sign in with the configured identity provider):

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - authenticated_user: true
    - client_certificate:
        fingerprint: '17859273e8a980631d367b2d5a6a6635412b0f22835f69e47b3f65624546a704'
```

Or, to enforce an allowlist of trusted certificate key pairs:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - authenticated_user: true
    - client_certificate:
        spki_hash:
          - 'FsDbM0rUYIiL3V339eIKqiz6HPSB+Pz2WeAWhqlqh8U='
          - 'pbdFxDXEtpabt3MZiik71farokMg6ZIn2azvsdXtZYA='
          - 'WTu9ETBS1/v/ll20erWcf+TAj7rzrJix/oCUv5GMPtg='
            ...
```

### Day of Week Matcher

The day of week matcher is a **string**. The string can either be `*`, a comma-separated list of days, or a dash-separated list of days.

- `*` matches all days.
- `,` matches either day (e.g. `mon,wed,fri`).
- `-` matches a range of days. (e.g. `mon-fri`). Days can be specified as English full day names, or as 3 character abbreviations. For example:

  ```yaml
  allow:
    and:
      - day_of_week: tue-fri
  ```

### Date Matcher

The date matcher is an object with operators as keys. It supports the following operators: `after` and `before`. The values are [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date strings. `after` means that the time of the request must be after the supplied date and `before` means that the time of the request must be before the supplied date. For example:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - date:
        after: 2020-01-02T16:20:00
        before: 2150-01-02T16:20:00
```

### Device Matcher

A device matcher is an object with operators as keys. It supports the following operators:

- `is` - an exact match of the device ID.
- `approved` - true if the device has been approved. This is an enterprise-only feature.
- `type` - Specifies the type of device to match on. The available types are `enclave_only` and `any`.
  - `enclave_only` will only match [platform authenticators](/docs/integrations/device-context/device-identity#secure-enclaves). These include TPM modules and hardware-backed keystores built into mobile devices.
  - `any` will also match [hardware security keys](/docs/integrations/device-context/device-identity#hardware-security-keys).

For example, a policy to allow any user with a registered device:

```yaml
- allow:
    or:
      - device:
          type: any
```

Compare to a policy that only allows a set of specific devices:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```yaml
- allow:
    or:
      - device:
          is: "5Vn3...C1RS"
      - device:
          is: "GAtL...doqu"
```

:::tip

Users can [find their device IDs](/docs/integrations/device-context/device-identity#find-the-device-id) at the `/.pomerium` endpoint from any route.

:::

### Record Matcher

The record matcher is an object that uses operators as keys. It points to records collected from an [external data source](/docs/capabilities/integrations) defined in the Enterprise Console. Pomerium matches requests to a specific external data source using a record's [foreign key](/docs/capabilities/integrations#foreign-key). You can use data stored in a record as external context in an authorization policy.

The record matcher supports all of the [String Matcher](/docs/internals/ppl#string-matcher) and [String List Matcher](/docs/internals/ppl#string-list-matcher) operators. However, the following operators are specific to the record matcher:

- `type`: Identifies the [Record Type](/docs/capabilities/integrations#record-type) as it's defined in the Enterprise Console
- `field`: Specifies the field name as defined by the external data source
- [Exists operator](#exists-operator)
- [Numerical comparison operators](#numerical-comparison-operators) (`<`, `<=`, `=`, `>`, `>=`)

#### Exists operator

The “exists” operator is a **boolean**:

- When set to `true`, it returns `ok` if it can find the corresponding external data source record in the Enterprise Console.
- When set to `false`, it returns `ok` if it can't find the corresponding external data source record in the Enterprise Console.

:::note

The "exists" operator does not require a "field" key.

        type: pomerium.io/ExternalDataSource
        field: trust_score
        '>=': 5
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### String Matcher

A string matcher is an object with operators as keys. It supports the following operators:

- `contains`: Returns true if the string contains the specified substring
- `ends_with`: Returns true if the string ends with the specified suffix
- `in`: Returns true if the string is present in the provided array of strings
- `not_in`: Returns true if the string is not present in the provided array of strings
- `is`: Returns true if the string exactly matches the specified value
- `starts_with`: Returns true if the string starts with the specified prefix

For example:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - email:
        starts_with: 'admin@'
```

Or:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - record:
        type: example.com/geoip
        field: country
        is: 'US'
```

To check if a user's role is one of several allowed values:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - email:
        in: ['user1@company.com', 'user2.company.com']
```

A string matcher can also be used with an array, a string, a number or a boolean, in which case it is the same as the `is` operator.

To enforce an allowlist by denying any value not in a known-safe set, use `not_in` under a `deny` rule. For example, to only allow specific tool names (see MCP policies):

```yaml
deny:
  and:
    - mcp_tool:
        not_in: ['query', 'list_tables']
```

### String List Matcher

A string list matcher is an object that supports a single `has` operator as a key. The `has` operator checks that a given string is present in a list of strings.

The `groups` and `record` criteria both support the `has` operator.

For example, using the `groups` criterion:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - groups:
        has: '00gv40ki4gmtCyl5d4x6'
```

Using the `record` criterion:

```yaml
- record:
    type: example.com/hr_user
    field: departments
    has: 'engineering'
```

A string list matcher can also be used with an array, a string, a number or a boolean, in which case it is the same as the `has` operator.

### Time of Day Matcher

The time of day matcher is an object with operators as keys. It supports the following operators: `timezone`, `after`, and `before`.

`timezone` is required and specifies the timezone to use when interpreting the supplied times. It is recommended to use city names (like `America/Phoenix`) instead of standard timezone abbreviations because standard timezones change throughout the year (i.e. EST becomes EDT and back again).

`after` means the time of the request must be after the supplied time and `before` means that the time of the request must be before the supplied time. For example:

```yaml
allow:
  and:
    - time_of_day:
        timezone: UTC
        after: 2:20:00
        before: 4:30PM
```

Values for `after` and `before` should match one of these formats:

- "3:04 PM"
- "3:04PM"
- "3 PM"
- "3PM"
- "15:04:05.999999999"
- "15:04:05"
- "15:04"

## Rego

:::caution Rego Usage Requires Extreme Care

Rego policies can be powerful, but improper usage may unintentionally open unauthorized access, deny valid requests, or even leak sensitive data. **Whenever possible, use [PPL](/docs/internals/ppl) instead**. If you're unsure whether your use case requires Rego, work with your Pomerium account representative or [contact support](mailto:support@pomerium.com) to see if your needs can be met using PPL-based policy criteria.

:::

Pomerium supports policies expressed in [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#rego) for organizations that prefer to use [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/).

See the [Outputs](#outputs), [Inputs](#inputs), and [Functions](#functions) reference sections below to learn how Rego policies apply to policy evaluation.

:::enterprise

Custom Rego policies is a [Pomerium Enterprise](/docs/deploy/enterprise) feature.

:::

In the [Enterprise Console](/docs/deploy/enterprise#enterprise-console), you can write custom Rego policies in the Rego Editor:

![Apply Rego in Console editor](./img/ppl/ppl-rego-policy.png)

:::note

A policy can only support PPL or Rego. Once one is set, the other tab is disabled.

:::

## Outputs

Authorization policy written in Rego is expected to return results in `allow` and/or `deny` rules:

```rego
# a policy that always allows access
allow := true
```

```rego
# a policy that always denies access
deny := true
```

Pomerium grants access according to the same rules as [PPL](/docs/internals/ppl#actions):

> Only two actions are supported: allow and deny. deny takes precedence over allow. More precisely: a user will have access to a route if at least one allow rule matches and no deny rules match.

`allow` and `deny` rules support four forms:

1. A simple boolean:

```rego
allow := true
```

2. An array with a single boolean value:

```rego
deny := [true]
```

3. An array with two values: a boolean and a **reason**:

```rego
allow := [false, "user-unauthorized"]
```

4. An array with three values: a boolean, a reason, and additional data:

```rego
allow := [false, "user-unauthorized", { "key": "value" }]
```

The **reason** value is useful for debugging, since it appears in [authorization logs](/docs/reference/authorize-log-fields#find-authorize-logs). There are two special reasons that trigger functionality in Pomerium:

- `user-unauthenticated` indicates that the user needs to sign in, and results in a redirect to the Authenticate service
- `device-unauthenticated` indicates that the user needs to register a new device

## Inputs

Rego scripts are evaluated with inputs available on the `input` object:

```rego
allow if input.http.method == "POST"
```

Rego defines the following inputs:

| **Input name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `http` | Object | Represents the HTTP request |
| `http.method` | String | The method used in the HTTP request |
| `http.hostname` | String | The hostname in the HTTP request |
| `http.path` | String | The path in the HTTP request |
| `http.url` | String | The full URL in the HTTP request |
| `http.headers` | Object | The headers in the HTTP request |
| `http.client_certificate` | Object | The client certificate details |
| `http.client_certificate.presented` | Boolean | `true` if the client presented a certificate |
| `http.client_certificate.leaf` | String | The leaf certificated provided by the client (unvalidated) |
| `http.client_certificate.intermediates` | String | The remainder of the client certificate chain |
| `http.ip` | String | The user's IP address |
| `http.session` | Object | Represents the user's session |
| `http.session.id` | String | The session ID |
| `http.is_valid_client_certificate` | Boolean | `true` if the presented client certificate is valid |
| `ssh` | Object | Represents the SSH connection |
| `ssh.username` | String | The username requested by the client |
| `ssh.publickey` | String | The client's SSH public key |

:::note

On SSH routes, `input.http.*` is not present. Use `input.ssh.*` instead.

:::

## Functions

The function below is available in Rego scripts:

- `get_databroker_record(record_type, record_id)`: Returns data from the Databroker service.

For example:

```rego
session := get_databroker_record("type.googleapis.com/session.Session", input.session.id)
```

### Example Rego policy

This example policy compares the `given_name` claim from a user's session against a list of popular first names, and only allows the 100 most popular first names.

```rego
package pomerium.policy
session = s {
  s = gset_databroker_record("type.googleapis.com/user.ServiceAccount", input.session.id)
  s != null
} else = s {
  s = get_databroker_record("type.googleapis.com/session.Session", input.session.id)
  s != null
} else = {} {
  true
}
user = u {
  u = get_databroker_record("type.googleapis.com/user.User", session.user_id)
} else = {} {
  true
}
allow = [true, {"custom-rego-authorized"}] {
  # grab all the claims from the user and session objects
  session_claims := object.get(session, "claims", {})
  user_claims := object.get(user, "claims", {})
  all_claims := object.union(session_claims, user_claims)
  # get the given_name claim. claim values are always an array of strings
  given_names := object.get(all_claims, "given_name", [])
  # query a JSON dump of the most popular baby names from 2020
  response := http.send({
    "method": "GET",
    "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aruljohn/popular-baby-names/master/2020/boy_names_2020.json",
    "force_json_decode": true,
  })
  # only include the top 100 names
  all_names := response.body.names
  popular_names := array.slice(all_names, 0, 99)
  # check that there's a given name in the popular names
  some i
  some j
  popular_names[i] == given_names[j]
} else = [false, {"custom-rego-unauthorized"}] {
  session.id != ""
} else = [false, {"user-unauthenticated"}] {
  true
}
```

This example pulls session data from the Databroker service using `type.googleapis.com/session.Session` for users and `type.googleapis.com/user.ServiceAccount` for service accounts.
