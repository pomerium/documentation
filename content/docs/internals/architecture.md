## System Level

Pomerium sits between end users and services requiring strong authentication. After verifying identity with your identity provider (IdP), Pomerium uses a configurable policy to decide how to route your user's request and if they are authorized to access the service. ([What's the difference between Authentication and Authorization?](https://www.pomerium.com/blog/authentication-v-authorization/))

## Component Level

Pomerium is composed of 4 logical components:

- Proxy Service ([What is a proxy?](https://www.pomerium.com/blog/proxy-vs-reverse-proxy/))

  - All user traffic flows through the proxy
  - Verifies all requests with Authentication service
  - Directs users to Authentication service to establish session identity
  - Processes policy to determine external/internal route mappings
  - Receives user OIDC tokens and session data from Authentication service and stores in Databroker service

- Authentication Service

  - Handles authentication flow to your IdP as needed
  - Handles identity verification after initial Authentication
  - Establishes user session cookie
  - Stores user OIDC tokens in Proxy service

- Authorization Service

  - Processes policy to determine permissions for each service
  - Handles authorization check for all user sessions
  - Directs Proxy service to initiate Authentication flow as required
  - Provides additional security related headers for upstream services to consume

- Databroker Service

  - Retrieves identity provider related data such as group membership
  - Stores and refreshes identity provider access and refresh tokens
  - Provides streaming authoritative session and identity data to Authorize service
  - Stores session and identity data in persistent storage

In production deployments, it is recommended that you deploy each component [separately](/docs/reference/service-mode). This allows you to limit external attack surface, as well as scale and manage the services independently.

In test deployments, all four components may run from a [single binary and configuration](/docs/reference#all-in-one-vs-split-service-mode).

## Authentication Flow

Pomerium's internal and external component interactions during full authentication from a fresh user are diagramed below.

After initial authentication to provide a session token, only the authorization check interactions occur.
