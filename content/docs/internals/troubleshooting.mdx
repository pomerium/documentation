This article provides troubleshooting information for various tools and features in Pomerium.

## Pomerium Core

### HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

By default, Pomerium sends the [`Strict-Transport-Security`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) response header to the browser, which pins the certificate to our browser for one year. This is common best practice to help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks but can create issues while a new Pomerium configuration is in development.

When you visit an endpoint while Pomerium is using an untrusted certificate (like the self-signed bootstrap certificate or a Let's Encrypt staging certificate), that certificate may be pinned in your browser. Once Pomerium is switched to a trusted production certificate, the untrusted cert must reset in the browser.

While developing your Pomerium environment, consider adjusting the [`SET_RESPONSE_HEADERS`](/docs/reference/set-response-headers) key to remove `Strict-Transport-Security` or reduce the `max-age` value until your production certificates are in place.

See [this article](https://www.ssl2buy.com/wiki/how-to-clear-hsts-settings-on-chrome-firefox-and-ie-browsers) for more information on clearing HSTS for specific endpoints across common browsers.

### JWT Authentication

When securing the Pomerium Authenticate service with a certificate signed by Let's Encrypt, your upstream applications may reject the certificate when attempting to access the JWT signing key. Here's an example log line from [Grafana](/docs/guides/grafana):

```log
logger=context error=Get "https://grafana.localhost.pomerium.io/.well-known/pomerium/jwks.json": x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```

This is often due to the recent expiration of the [DST Root CA X3](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/dst-root-ca-x3-expiration-september-2021/) certificate. Many default keystores used by docker images and less-frequently updated distributions still carry this expired certificate. Even though Let's Encrypt certs are cross-signed with the [ISRG Root X1](https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/) CA certificate, some applications will still reject them.

To clarify; this does not mean that the upstream service is rejecting the JWT signing key. Rather, it doesn't trust the Let's Encrypt certificate used by the Authorize service for TLS, and so it will not read the JWKS file.

For upstream applications that can use a local signing key file, you can circumvent this issue using `curl` or `wget` to download the signing key locally (relative to the upstream service). Using Grafana again as an example:

1.  Download the `jwks.json` file from the authenticate server:

    <Tabs>

    <TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

    ```bash
    curl https://grafana.localhost.pomerium.io/.well-known/pomerium/jwks.json > /etc/grafana/jwks.json
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="wget" label="wget">

    ```bash
    wget -O /etc/grafana/jwks.json https://grafana.localhost.pomerium.io/.well-known/pomerium/jwks.json
    ```

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

1.  Edit the upstream service configuration to use the local key to verify tokens:

    ```ini
    [auth.jwt]
    enabled = true
    header_name = X-Pomerium-Jwt-Assertion
    email_claim = email
    jwk_set_file = /etc/grafana/jwks.json
    cache_ttl = 60m
    ```

### Kubernetes Ingress Controller

#### View Event History

Pomerium Ingress Controller will add **events** to the Ingress objects as it processes them.

```
kubectl describe ingress/my-ingress
```

```log
Events:
  Type    Reason   Age   From              Message
  ----    ------   ----  ----              -------
  Normal  Updated  18s   pomerium-ingress  updated pomerium configuration
```

If an error occurs, it may be reflected in the events:

```log
Events:
  Type     Reason       Age                 From              Message
  ----     ------       ----                ----              -------
  Normal   Updated      5m53s               pomerium-ingress  updated pomerium configuration
  Warning  UpdateError  3s                  pomerium-ingress  upsert routes: parsing ingress: annotations: applying policy annotations: parsing policy: invalid rules in policy: unsupported conditional "maybe", only and, or, not, nor and action are allowed
```

### Shared Secret Mismatch

Pomerium's independent services communicate securely using a [shared secret](/docs/reference/shared-secret). When services or the databroker have mismatched secrets, Pomerium will fail.

Pomerium Core will log a shared secret mismatch with:

```json
{
  "level": "error",
  "syncer_id": "authorize",
  "syncer_type": "",
  "error": "rpc error: code = Unauthenticated desc = invalid JWT: go-jose/go-jose: error in cryptographic primitive",
  "time": "2022-03-22T07:26:14-04:00",
  "message": "sync"
}
```

And Pomerium Enterprise will log the error with:

```json
{
  "level": "error",
  "ts": "2022-03-22T07:21:02-04:00",
  "caller": "dashboard/server.go:187",
  "msg": "syncer",
  "error": "failed to sync all devices: rpc error: code = Unauthenticated desc = invalid JWT: go-jose/go-jose: error in cryptographic primitive",
  "stacktrace": "github.com/pomerium/pomerium-console/svc/dashboard.(*Server).Run.func2\n\t/PATH/TO/POMERIUM/CONSOLE/SERVICE/svc/dashboard/server.go:187\ngolang.org/x/sync/errgroup.(*Group).Go.func1\n\t/Users/tgroth/workspace/go/pkg/mod/golang.org/x/sync@v0.0.0-20210220032951-036812b2e83c/errgroup/errgroup.go:57"
}
{
  "level": "info",
  "ts": "2022-03-22T07:21:02-04:00",
  "caller": "dashboard/server.go:202",
  "msg": "stopping dashboard servers"
}
```

Update the [shared secret](/docs/reference/shared-secret) across all Pomerium services to match the one set for the Databroker.

#### Redis Secret Mismatch

:::caution

The use of Redis as the databroker storage type has been deprecated in favor of Postgres. See [Previous Versions](https://v17.docs.pomerium.com/docs/internals/troubleshooting#redis-secret-mismatch) of this page for information regarding Redis.

### RPC Errors

#### certificate signed by unknown authority

When authenticating and authorizing a user for the first time, you may see the following in your Pomerium logs:

```log
ERR http-error error="401 Unauthorized: ..... rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = latest connection error: connection error: desc = "transport: authentication handshake failed: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority...."
```

**Why**

This error means that the proxy is rejecting the Authorize service's supplied certificate (used to establish a secure connection) because it doesn't know or trust the certificate authority that signed it.

**Solution**

Ensure that the Proxy service knows about and trusts the certificate authority that signed the Authorize service's certificate.

- Add the certificate authority directly into Pomerium using the [certificate authority](/docs/reference/certificate-authority) config setting.
- Add the certificate authority to the system's underlying trust store.
- Replace your system / docker image certificate bundle.

  For Docker:

  ```docker
  COPY --from=builder /etc/ssl/certs/your-cert-bundle.crt /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
  ```

- Finally, ensure that you aren't being man-in-the-middle'd or that some eager router isn't injecting its own certificate along the way. Use openssl to verify that your Proxy service is getting the certificate you think its getting.

  ```bash
  openssl s_client -servername pomerium.io -connect pomerium.io:443 </dev/null \
  | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p'
  ```

#### rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded

When authenticating and authorizing a user for the first time, you may get the following in your Pomerium logs.

```log
{"level":"error",..."error":"rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded","http-message":"rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded","http-code":500,"message":"http-error"}
```

**Why**

The Proxy service is not able to create a connection with the authorization service to validate a user.

**Solution**

Usually, this is the result of either a routing issue or a configuration error. Make sure that you are using the _internally_ routable URL for the Authorize service. Many cloud loud balancers _do not_ yet support gRPC transposing the ingress. So while your authenticate service url will probably look like `https://authenticate.corp.example.com`, your authorizer service url will likely be more like `https://pomerium-authorize-service.default.svc.cluster.local` or `https://localhost:5443`.

## Envoy error messages

Because Pomerium relies on Envoy to manage HTTP connections, you will notice Envoy connection errors and messages at some point in your logs as you configure Pomerium.

The [Envoy Response Code Details](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_conn_man/response_code_details.html) provides an exhaustive list of Envoy-related message details.

We've repurposed a truncated version of the Response Code Details list in the table below for your convenience:

| **Name** | **Description** |
| :-- | :-- |
| absolute_path_rejected | The request was rejected due to using an absolute path on a route not supporting them. |
| admin_filter_response | The response was generated by the admin filter. |
| cluster_not_found | The request was rejected by the router filter because there was no cluster found for the selected route. |
| downstream_local_disconnect | The client connection was locally closed for the provided reason. |
| downstream_remote_disconnect | The client disconnected unexpectedly. |
| duration_timeout | The max connection duration was exceeded. |
| direct_response | A direct response was generated by the router filter. |
| filter_added_invalid_request_data | A filter added request data at the wrong stage in the filter chain. |
| filter_added_invalid_response_data | A filter added response data at the wrong stage in the filter chain. |
| filter_chain_not_found | The request was rejected due to no matching filter chain. |
| filter_removed_required_request_headers | The request was rejected in the filter manager because a configured filter removed required request headers. |
| filter_removed_required_response_headers | The response was rejected in the filter manager because a configured filter removed required response headers or these values were invalid (e.g. overflown status). |
| internal_redirect | The original stream was replaced with an internal redirect. |
| low_version | The HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/0.9 request was rejected due to HTTP/1.0 support not being configured. |
| maintenance_mode | The request was rejected by the router filter because the cluster was in maintenance mode. |
| max_duration_timeout | The per-stream max duration timeout was exceeded. |
| missing_host_header | The request was rejected due to a missing Host: or :authority field. |
| missing_path_rejected | The request was rejected due to a missing Path or :path header field. |
| no_healthy_upstream | The request was rejected by the router filter because there was no healthy upstream found. |
| overload | The request was rejected due to the Overload Manager reaching configured resource limits. |
| rejecting_because_detection_failed | The request was rejected because the original IP couldn’t be detected. |
| path_normalization_failed | The request was rejected because path normalization was configured on and failed, probably due to an invalid path. |
| request_headers_failed_strict_check | The request was rejected due to x-envoy-\* headers failing strict header validation. |
| request_overall_timeout | The per-stream total request timeout was exceeded. |
| request_payload_exceeded_retry_buffer_limit | Envoy is doing streaming proxying but too much data arrived while waiting to attempt a retry. |
| request_payload_too_large | Envoy is doing non-streaming proxying and the request payload exceeded configured limits. |
| response_payload_too_large | Envoy is doing non-streaming proxying and the response payload exceeded configured limits. |
| route_configuration_not_found | The request was rejected because there was no route configuration found. |
| route_not_found | The request was rejected because there was no route found. |
| stream_idle_timeout | The per-stream keepalive timeout was exceeded. |
| upgrade_failed | The request was rejected because it attempted an unsupported upgrade. |
| upstream_max_stream_duration_reached | The request was destroyed because of it exceeded the configured max stream duration. |
| upstream_per_try_timeout | The final upstream try timed out. |
| upstream_reset_after_response_started{details} | The upstream connection was reset after a response was started. This may include further details about the cause of the disconnect. |
| upstream_reset_before_response_started{details} | The upstream connection was reset before a response was started This may include further details about the cause of the disconnect. |
| upstream_response_timeout | The upstream response timed out. |
| via_upstream | The response code was set by the upstream. |

## Miscellaneous

### Invalid Certificates from Command Line Tools

When using Let's Encrypt certificates, you must use the `fullchain.pem` file, not `cert.pem` in order to include intermediate certs. Browsers like Chrome will store intermediate certs for LE but other tools (like `curl`) don't, which is why your route might look fine in a web browser, but not when curl'd or used for TCP tunneling.
