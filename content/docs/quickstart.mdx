# Pomerium Zero Quickstart

In this Quickstart, you'll install and run Pomerium Zero in a Docker container. By the end, you'll have a **personal account** and cluster where you can configure routes and policies to your own apps and services.

## Before you start:

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Create a [**free Pomerium Zero account**](https://console.pomerium.app/create-account)

## Get Pomerium Zero configuration

In the onboarding console, select the **Docker** tab and copy the Docker Compose configuration.

Paste the configuration in a `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
services:
  pomerium:
    image: pomerium/pomerium:v0.25.1
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    restart: always
    environment:
    // highlight-start
      POMERIUM_ZERO_TOKEN: <REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TOKEN>
    // highlight-end
      XDG_CACHE_HOME: /var/cache
      AUTOCERT_DIR: /var/cache/autocert
    volumes:
      - pomerium-cache:/var/cache

volumes:
  pomerium-cache:
```

Replace the value of `POMERIUM_ZERO_TOKEN` with the one generated for you in the onboarding config. The token links this **Pomerium Zero Cluster** with your account.

## Run Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Pomerium Zero will attempt to detect your **public IP** address to connect you to your cluster.

But, it won't be able to because you're running Pomerium Zero in an isolated container with its own private network and IP address.

## Apply custom IP address

To connect Pomerium Zero to your cluster, you need to enter a **custom IP address** to override your detected one.

If you're testing with `localhost`, enter `127.0.0.1`, or enter your preferred IP address.

You can also change your listening port:

Select **Apply** to connect to your cluster:

[ image ]

Once you've connected, select **Finish**.

## Connect to upstream services

In the Zero Console, you'll notice we've provisioned two routes for you:
