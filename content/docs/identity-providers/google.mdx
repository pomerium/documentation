This guide covers the basics of setting up Pomerium to use GCP and Google Workspace / G Suite as your identity provider.

:::caution

Google changes their configuration screens frequently. Please refer to Google's documentation for authoritative instructions.

- [Setting up OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect)
- [Perform Google Workspace Domain-Wide Delegation of Authority](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation)

:::

## Setting up OAuth 2.0

You need [OAuth 2.0 credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect), including a client ID and client secret, to authenticate users.

### Create OAuth 2.0

Log in to your Google account and go to the [APIs & services](https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/credentials).

1. Navigate to **Credentials** using the left-hand menu. If you're not already in a project, you can select one here.

1. On the **Credentials** page, click **Create credentials** and choose **OAuth [Client ID]**.

  ![Create New Credentials](./img/google/google-credentials.png)

  :::caution
  If you don't currently have an OAuth consent page configured, Google will not allow you to create credentials until this is completed. Please follow Google's [instructions](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect#consentpageexperience) for doing so.
  :::

1. For the **Application type** choose **Web application**.

1. Give the client ID a Name, and add an **Authorized redirect URI**. The redirect URI format is `https://${authenticate_service_url}/oauth2/callback` (e.g.`https://authenticate.localhost.pomerium.io/oauth2/callback`).

  ![Web App Credentials Configuration](./img/google/google-create-client-id-config.png)

  Click **Create** once complete.

1. The Google Cloud Console will display your Client ID and Client Secret. Temporarily save these values to import into Pomerium later.

## Setting up directory Sync

### Create a service account

In order for Pomerium to validate group membership, we'll also need to configure a [service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) with [G-suite domain-wide delegation](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation) enabled.

1. Open the [**Service accounts** page](https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts). If prompted, select a project.

1. Click **+ Create Service Account**, enter a name and description for the service account. You can use the default service account ID, or choose a different, unique one. When done click **Create and continue**.

1. The next sections, labeled **Grant this service account access to project** and **Grant users access to this service account**, are not required. Click **Continue** to both, and then **Create**.

1. Select your new service account, and click on the **KEYS** tab. Select **Add key**, then **Create new key**:

  ![Creating a new key for a Google service account](./img/google/google-service-account-create-key.png)

  In the side panel that appears, select the format for your key: **JSON**.

1. Click **Create**. Your new public/private key pair is generated and downloaded to your machine; it serves as the only copy of this key. For information on how to store it securely, see [Managing service account keys](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts#managing_service_account_keys).

1. Click **Close** on the **Private key saved to your computer** dialog, then click **←** to return to the table of your service accounts.

Next, we need to enable enable G Suite domain-wide delegation:

1. Locate the newly-created service account in the table. Under **Actions**, click **Manage Details**.

1. In the service account details, click **Advanced settings**. **Show domain-wide delegation**, then ensure the **Enable G Suite Domain-wide Delegation** checkbox is checked.

  :::caution
  Domain-wide delegation may not be possible from here, depending on what type of Google account you have, as well as Google's updates to their interface. Consult their documentation on [Domain-Wide Delegation of Authority] as needed. 

  If you haven't yet configured your app's OAuth consent screen, you must do so before you can enable domain-wide delegation. Follow the on-screen instructions to [configure the OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615?hl=en&ref_topic=3473162#), then repeat the above steps and re-check the checkbox.
  :::

1. Click **Save** to update the service account, and return to the table of service accounts. A new column, **Domain-wide delegation**, can be seen. Click **View Client ID**, to obtain and make a note of the client ID.

### Set the impersonating user

Open the key file downloaded earlier in a text editor, and add an `impersonate_user` field to the JSON. In this case, we'd be impersonating the admin account `user@pomerium.io`.

:::caution

[Google requires][so-answer] that service accounts act on behalf of another user. You MUST add the `impersonate_user` field to your json key file.

:::

```git title="pomerium-oauth-226e52af9cdd.json"
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "pomerium-redacted",
  "private_key_id": "e07f7c93870c7e03f883560ecd8fd0f4d27b0081",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "redacted@pomerium-redacted.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "101215990458000334387",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/redacted%40pomerium-redacted.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
+  "impersonate_user": "user@pomerium.com"
}
```

The base64 encoded contents of this public/private key pair json file will used for the value of the IdP [service account] configuration setting:

```bash
cat pomerium-oauth-226e52af9cdd.json | base64 -w 0
```

### Set directory permissions for Workspaces

Next, we need to give that service account permissionson the GSuite / Workspace side of the house.

1. From your Google Workspace domain's [Admin console](http://admin.google.com/) Main menu, go to **Security** > **Access and data control** > **API controls**.

1. In the **Domain wide delegation** pane, select **Manage Domain Wide Delegation**.

1. Click **Add new**.

1. In the **Client ID** field, enter the client ID obtained from the service account creation steps above.

1. In the **OAuth Scopes** field, enter a comma-delimited list of the scopes required for your application (for a list of possible scopes, see [Authorize requests](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/authorizing)).

  Include at a minimum the following list of scopes:
    - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly`
    - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly`

1. Click the **Authorize** button.

## Configure Pomerium

Edit `config.yaml` or set  your [environment variables] to connect Pomerium to Google:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="config.yaml" label="config.yaml">

```yaml title=/etc/pomerium/config.yaml
idp-provider: "google"
idp-client-id: "yyyy.apps.googleusercontent.com"
idp-client-secret: "xxxxxx"
idp-service-account: "zzzz" # output of `base64 -i service-account-key.json`, with impersonate_user set.
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Environment Variables" label="Environment Variables">

```bash
IDP_PROVIDER="google"
IDP_CLIENT_ID="yyyy.apps.googleusercontent.com"
IDP_CLIENT_SECRET="xxxxxx"
IDP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT="zzzz" # output of `base64 -i service-account-key.json`, with impersonate_user set.
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

### `invalid service account for Google directory provider`

This error message in Pomerium log output coincides with an empty **Groups** field in the `/.pomerium` endpoint. It indicates that your [service account](#create-a-service-account) is missing or incorrectly configured. Revisit the linked section above to adjust your service account settings as needed.
