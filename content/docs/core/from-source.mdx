# Building Pomerium From Source

This document covers how to retrieve and build Pomerium from its source code as well as how to run Pomerium using a minimal but complete configuration.

## Prerequisites

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [go](https://golang.org/doc/install) programming language
- A configured [identity provider]

## Download

Retrieve the latest copy of Pomerium's source code by cloning the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium.git $HOME/pomerium
```

## Create local certs

In production, we'd use a public certificate authority such as LetsEncrypt. For local development, we can use [mkcert](https://mkcert.dev/) to make locally trusted development certificates with any names you'd like.

```bash
# Install mkcert.
go install filippo.io/mkcert@latest
# Bootstrap mkcert's root certificate into your operating system's trust store.
mkcert -install
# Create your wildcard domain.
# *.localhost.pomerium.io is helper domain we've hard-coded to route to localhost
mkcert "*.localhost.pomerium.io"
```

## Build

Build Pomerium from source in a single step using make.

```bash
cd $HOME/pomerium
make
```

[Make] will run all the tests, some code linters, then build the binary. If all is good, you should now have a freshly built Pomerium binary for your architecture and operating system in the `pomerium/bin` directory.

If you don't have the prerequisites for the tests (Docker, Redis, etc) locally, you can instead run `make build` to just create the binary.

## Configure

Pomerium supports setting [configuration variables] using both environmental variables and using a configuration file. Here, we'll use a file.

Create a config file (`config.yaml`). This file will be use to determine Pomerium's configuration settings, routes, and access-policies. Consider the following example:

<ConfigMinimal />

## Run

Finally, run Pomerium specifying the configuration file `config.yaml`.

```bash
./bin/pomerium -config config.yaml
```

Browse to `verify.localhost.pomerium.io`. Connections between you and [verify] will now be proxied and managed by Pomerium.
