Adding a [hex code](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) to the Primary Color setting will affect the majority of the theming on the console.
For more details on how the types of colors will impact the look and feel of Pomerium, see [material ui](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0)'s color documentation.
