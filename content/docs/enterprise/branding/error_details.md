It is possible to customize the error messages displayed on 403 unauthorized pages.

This feature is enabled on a per Route basis by toggling the setting in the General Tab of the Route settings.

![Enable Error Details](img/enable_error_details.png)

Error Message will appear similar to this example.

![Extra Error Details](img/error_details_enabled.png)

Policies without an explanation or remediation field will show the policy ID.

If the explanation or remediation fields are added to the policy they will show up in the error details.
