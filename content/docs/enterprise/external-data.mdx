Pomerium Enterprise Console's external data feature allows you to poll data from sources other than your identity provider (**IdP**) to make context-aware policy decisions. Pomerium provides several data sources as examples, but we encourage you to create (and share with the community) your own integrations to expand your data-driven policies.

See the pages in this section for more information on our example data sources, or learn how to create your own by reviewing our [datasource](https://github.com/pomerium/datasource) repository.
