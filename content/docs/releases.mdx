## Release timing

The current release cycle is aligned on a monthly basis. Pre-`1.0.0` we target a `MINOR` release on or around the **first day of each month**. We try to hit the targets as closely as possible, while still delivering a quality release.

## Versioning

Pomerium uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). In practice this means for a given version number **vMAJOR**.**MINOR**.**PATCH** (e.g. `v0.1.0`):

- **MAJOR** indicates an incompatible API change,
- **MINOR** indicates a new functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
- **PATCH** indicates a backwards-compatible bug fix.

As Pomerium is still pre-`v1.0.0`, breaking changes between releases should be expected.

To see difference between releases, please refer to the changelog and upgrading documents.
